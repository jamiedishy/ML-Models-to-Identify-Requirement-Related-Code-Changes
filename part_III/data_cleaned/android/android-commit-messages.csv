9,Merge commit \u0027refs/changes/99/17199/1\u0027 of ssh://review.source.android.com:29418/platform/external/qemu into timer-cleanup\n
10,"Permanent fix for workaround of timer issue (commit a7f114bc).\n\nThe compiler generated incorrect instructions when loading timers\nbecause qemu_get_be64 was used before it was declared. This caused\nthe compiler to assume that a normal (32 bit) int would be returned\nrather than a 64 bit one. Just including the \hw/hw.h\"" header is\nsufficient to correct this.\n\nThe makefile for the project has recently been changed to build with\n-Wall which should prevent this from going unnoticed again.\n\nChange-Id: I74c98183287cf26b767a36f7a6ff9ebf0b891826\n"""
11,Fix an issue where src files can be deleted in ADT.\n\nOlder projects generated the java class (R aidl) into\nthe main src folder.\n\nThere is code in ADT to migrate them to the new model\n(where generated classes go in gen/) by removing derived\nresources from the source folder. This is also used\nby the clean feature of the pre-compiler builder\nto clean the content of gen.\n\nTo make it better in ADT 0.9.8 we added something to\ndelete the folder containing the derived resources.\nExcept this doesn\u0027t check if the folder is not empty\nafter the derived resources have been deleted (or\nnot if it contained non-derived resources).\n\nthis means importing older projects (or possibly\nteam projects -- see http://b.android.com/11347)\nwould delete the whole content of the source folder.\n\nThis change makes sure that only folders for which\nall members have been deleted are deleted.\n\nChange-Id: I04b6d986fb3e454a259213fcda197400e9e7c974\n

38,Media Player fix for pause after system suspend/resume\n\nDescription: During system wide suspend/resume call the state machine for\nstagefright player \u0026 awesome player are reset and the flags are updated\naccordingly. But the state variables inside Media player class are left\nat the play/paused state depending on the current state while suspend call\nis issued.\nbecause of this mismatch in the states between media player and the awesome\nplayer the subsequent calls to isPlaying() query inside media player is\nsetting the state to Paused as a error correction mechanism. since the\nmedia player state is incorrectly set as paused even though it was in started\nstate during suspend all the subsequent calls to pause will return without\nany action.\n\nInorder to correct this the suspend state is introduced in the media player.\nThe current state is saved during suspend and is properly restored on resume\ncall.\n\nValidation: Tested AV playback pause/resume several times along with multiple\nsystem wide suspend/resume transitions.\n\nChange-Id: If7d40260c05899fac551edabaa8051bac1d0d020\nSigned-off-by: Sunita Nadampalli \u003csunitan@ti.com\u003e\n

55,More CTS Test Runner Fixes\n\nChanging the initial status of tests now to fail and\nmaking InstrumentationCtsTestRunner explicitly report\nwhen it has omitted a test due to profile or feature\nrequirements only.\n\nMore background on why:\n\nInitially the starting test status was set to PASS.\nThis seemed like a bug because tests that did not\nget a result back from the test runner would automatically\npass.\n\nI noticed this when adding the profile/feature annotations\nso I changed the test status to NOT_EXECUTED. However\nI discovered that batch test runner would rerun any tests\nthat were not executed so any tests that were discarded\nby the annotations would be rerun infinitely..\n\nSo then...I changed the test status to start off as OMITTED\nso that discarded tests which don\u0027t produce any output would\nget flagged as OMITTED and not cause infinite retrying.\n\nHowever this uncovered a whole class of tests that were\nbeing omitted due to test errors (previously marked PASS even\nthough they were failing). This is because the tests would\nfail to execute as a batch and then CTS as part of its algorithm\nwould run them individually again. However due to an error\nof being unable to load the test class they would be marked\nas PASS (before the OMITTED change) because there would be\noutput from the runner...\n\nBy setting the default status to FAIL there won\u0027t be any tests\nthat get away as PASS due to getting no output from the runner.\nUnfortunately this means any tests that aren\u0027t executed or\nthrown out by annotations will be flagged. There seems to be\na couple of tests marked with @Suppress that will need to be\nchanged to @BrokenTest. There is probably a more involved fix\nto fix these things but its probably not worth it at this time.\n\nThe default status also cannot be ERROR because CTS sees both\nerrors and failures as the same.\n\nChange-Id: If1d561ee0e8c4919287469238d29c72c1ba0475c\n

The reader acquires slot(s) for item(s) including the index 0 item.\n3.  The non-zero index item is deleted and as a consequence the other item is\n    moved to the root of the tree.

The zero item is deleted removing it from the direct slot it remains in\n    the rcu-delayed indirect node.\n4.  The reader looks at the index 0 slot and finds that the page has 0 ref\n    count\n5.  The reader looks at it again hoping that the item will either be freed or\n    the ref count will increase. This never happens as the slot it is looking\n    at will never be updated.

So there\u0027s a small window\nbetween the find_get_page() and -\u003eis_partially_uptodate() where the page\ncould get truncated and page-\u003emapping cleared.\n\nWe _have_ a reference so it can\u0027t get reclaimed but it certainly\ncan be truncated.\n\nI think the correct thing is to check page-\u003emapping after the\ntrylock_page() and jump out if it got truncated.  This patch has been\nrunning in the test environment for a month or so now and we have not\nseen this bug pop up again.\n\nxmon info:\n\n  1f:mon\u003e e\n  cpu 0x1f: Vector: 300 (Data Access) at [c0000002ae36f770]\n      pc: c0000000001e7a6c: .block_is_partially_uptodate+0xc/0x100\n      lr: c000000000142944: .generic_file_aio_read+0x1e4/0x770\n      sp: c0000002ae36f9f0\n     msr: 8000000000009032\n     dar: 0\n   dsisr: 40000000\n    current \u003d 0xc000000378f99e30\n    paca    \u003d 0xc000000000f66300\n      pid   \u003d 21946 comm \u003d bash\n  1f:mon\u003e r\n  R00 \u003d 0025c0500000006d   R16 \u003d 0000000000000000\n  R01 \u003d c0000002ae36f9f0   R17 \u003d c000000362cd3af0\n  R02 \u003d c000000000e8cd80   R18 \u003d ffffffffffffffff\n  R03 \u003d c0000000031d0f88   R19 \u003d 0000000000000001\n  R04 \u003d c0000002ae36fa68   R20 \u003d c0000003bb97b8a0\n  R05 \u003d 0000000000000000   R21 \u003d c0000002ae36fa68\n  R06 \u003d 0000000000000000   R22 \u003d 0000000000000000\n  R07 \u003d 0000000000000001   R23 \u003d c0000002ae36fbb0\n  R08 \u003d 0000000000000002   R24 \u003d 0000000000000000\n  R09 \u003d 0000000000000000   R25 \u003d c000000362cd3a80\n  R10 \u003d 0000000000000000   R26 \u003d 0000000000000002\n  R11 \u003d c0000000001e7b60   R27 \u003d 0000000000000000\n  R12 \u003d 0000000042000484   R28 \u003d 0000000000000001\n  R13 \u003d c000000000f66300   R29 \u003d c0000003bb97b9b8\n  R14 \u003d 0000000000000001   R30 \u003d c000000000e28a08\n  R15 \u003d 000000000000ffff   R31 \u003d c0000000031d0f88\n  pc  \u003d c0000000001e7a6c .block_is_partially_uptodate+0xc/0x100\n  lr  \u003d c000000000142944 .generic_file_aio_read+0x1e4/0x770\n  msr \u003d 8000000000009032   cr  \u003d 22000488\n  ctr \u003d c0000000001e7a60   xer \u003d 0000000020000000   trap \u003d  300\n  dar \u003d 0000000000000000   dsisr \u003d 40000000\n  1f:mon\u003e t\n  [link register   ] c000000000142944 .generic_file_aio_read+0x1e4/0x770\n  [c0000002ae36f9f0] c000000000142a14 .generic_file_aio_read+0x2b4/0x770 (unreliable)\n  [c0000002ae36fb40] c0000000001b03e4 .do_sync_read+0xd4/0x160\n  [c0000002ae36fce0] c0000000001b153c .vfs_read+0xec/0x1f0\n  [c0000002ae36fd80] c0000000001b1768 .SyS_read+0x58/0xb0\n  [c0000002ae36fe30] c00000000000852c syscall_exit+0x0/0x40\n  --- Exception: c00 (System Call) at 00000080a840bc54\n  SP (fffca15df30) is in userspace\n  1f:mon\u003e di c0000000001e7a6c\n  c0000000001e7a6c  e9290000      ld      r90(r9)\n  c0000000001e7a70  418200c0      beq     c0000000001e7b30        # .block_is_partially_uptodate+0xd0/0x100\n  c0000000001e7a74  e9440008      ld      r108(r4)\n  c0000000001e7a78  78a80020      clrldi  r8r532\n  c0000000001e7a7c  3c000001      lis     r01\n  c0000000001e7a80  812900a8      lwz     r9168(r9)\n  c0000000001e7a84  39600001      li      r111\n  c0000000001e7a88  7c080050      subf    r0r8r0\n  c0000000001e7a8c  7f805040      cmplw   cr7r0r10\n  c0000000001e7a90  7d6b4830      slw     r11r11r9\n  c0000000001e7a94  796b0020      clrldi  r11r1132\n  c0000000001e7a98  419d00a8      bgt     cr7c0000000001e7b40    # .block_is_partially_uptodate+0xe0/0x100\n  c0000000001e7a9c  7fa55840      cmpld   cr7r5r11\n  c0000000001e7aa0  7d004214      add     r8r0r8\n  c0000000001e7aa4  79080020      clrldi  r8r832\n  c0000000001e7aa8  419c0078      blt     cr7c0000000001e7b20    # .block_is_partially_uptodate+0xc0/0x100\n\nSigned-off-by: Dave Hansen \u003cdave@linux.vnet.ibm.com\u003e\nReviewed-by: Minchan Kim \u003cminchan.kim@gmail.com\u003e\nReviewed-by: Johannes Weiner \u003channes@cmpxchg.org\u003e\nAcked-by: Rik van Riel \u003criel@redhat.com\u003e\nCc: \u003carunabal@in.ibm.com\u003e\nCc: \u003csbest@us.ibm.com\u003e\nCc: Christoph Hellwig \u003chch@lst.de\u003e\nCc: Al Viro \u003cviro@zeniv.linux.org.uk\u003e\nCc: Minchan Kim \u003cminchan.kim@gmail.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton \u003cakpm@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

146,"intel-gtt: fix gtt_total_entries detection\n\ncommit e5e408fc94595aab897f613b6f4e2f5b36870a6f upstream.\n\nIn commit f1befe71 Chris Wilson added some code to clear the full gtt\non g33/pineview instead of just the mappable part. The code looks like\nit was copy-pasted from agp/intel-gtt.c at least an identical piece\nof code is still there (in intel_i830_init_gtt_entries). This lead to\na regression in 2.6.35 which was supposedly fixed in commit e7b96f28\n\nNow this commit makes absolutely no sense to me. It seems to be\nslightly confused about chipset generations - it references docs for\n4th gen but the regression concerns 3rd gen g33. Luckily the the g33\ngmch docs are available with the GMCH Graphics Control pci config\nregister definitions. The other (bigger problem) is that the new\ncheck in there uses the i830 stolen mem bits (.5M 1M or 8M of stolen\nmem). They are different since the i855GM.\n\nThe most likely case is that it hits the 512M fallback which was\nprobably the right thing for the boxes this was tested on.\n\nSo the original approach by Chris Wilson seems to be wrong and the\ncurrent code is definitely wrong. There is a third approach by Jesse\nBarnes from his RFC patch \Who wants a bigger GTT mapping range?\""\nwhere he simply shoves g33 in the same clause like later chipset\ngenerations.\n\nI\u0027ve asked him and Jesse confirmed that this should work. So implement\nit.\n\nBugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d16891$\nTested-by: Anisse Astier \u003canisse@astier.eu\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Anisse Astier \u003canisse@astier.eu\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Vetter \u003cdaniel.vetter@ffwll.ch\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Chris Wilson \u003cchris@chris-wilson.co.uk\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n"""

When\ndo_execve() succeds or fails we change this counter back.\n\nTechnically this is not 100% correct we can\u0027t know if the new\npage is swapped out and turn MM_ANONPAGES into MM_SWAPENTS but\nI don\u0027t think this really matters and everything becomes correct\nonce exec changes -\u003emm or fails.\n\nReported-by: Brad Spengler \u003cspender@grsecurity.net\u003e\nReviewed-and-discussed-by: KOSAKI Motohiro \u003ckosaki.motohiro@jp.fujitsu.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Oleg Nesterov \u003coleg@redhat.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

357,overlay.h - Added a new API setAttributes to data side\n\nCurrently the display driver allocates cacheable buffers always.\nCacheable buffers are needed mainly for video record use case\nwith VSTAB(Video Stablilization). VSTAB runs on ARM and hence\nworks faster with cached buffers. Because of these cacheable\nbuffers display driver has to flush the cache before rendering.\nBut for video playback use case we don\u0027t need cached buffers\nso this flush operation in driver is an overhead. We can improve\npower and performance numbers by avoiding the flush operation\nin driver. Therefore we want to make this(cacheable buffers)\na configurable option. So we would like to add the following\nDATA API to the overlay module:\n\nint overlay_setAttributes( struct overlay_data_device_t *dev\n                           int param int value)\n\nThis interface will have to be available as data side API\nbecause CameraHAL or video MIO node would know what the use\ncase is and can set required buffer attributes. The attributes\nwhich can be set would be cacheable or non cacheable buffers\nphysically contiguous buffers etc.\n\nSigned-off-by: Anu Sundararajan \u003csanuradha@ti.com\u003e\n

422,Bluetooth: Allow SCO/eSCO packet type selection for outgoing SCO connections.\n\n__u16 sco_pkt_type is introduced to struct sockaddr_sco. It allows bitwise\nselection of SCO/eSCO packet types. Currently those bits are:\n\n0x0001 HV1 may be used.\n0x0002 HV2 may be used.\n0x0004 HV3 may be used.\n0x0008 EV3 may be used.\n0x0010 EV4 may be used.\n0x0020 EV5 may be used.\n0x0040 2-EV3 may be used.\n0x0080 3-EV3 may be used.\n0x0100 2-EV5 may be used.\n0x0200 3-EV5 may be used.\n\nThis is similar to the Packet Type parameter in the HCI Setup Synchronous\nConnection Command except that we are not reversing the logic on the EDR bits.\nThis makes the use of sco_pkt_tpye forward portable for the use case of\nwhite-listing packet types which we expect will be the primary use case.\n\nIf sco_pkt_type is zero or userspace uses the old struct sockaddr_sco\nthen the default behavior is to allow all packet types.\n\nPacket type selection is just a request made to the Bluetooth chipset and\nit is up to the link manager on the chipset to negiotiate and decide on the\nactual packet types used. Furthermore when a SCO/eSCO connection is eventually\nmade there is no way for the host stack to determine which packet type was used\n(however it is possible to get the link type of SCO or eSCO).\n\nsco_pkt_type is ignored for incoming SCO connections. It is possible\nto add this in the future as a parameter to the Accept Synchronous Connection\nCommand however its a little trickier because the kernel does not\ncurrently preserve sockaddr_sco data between userspace calls to accept().\n\nThe most common use for sco_pkt_type will be to white-list only SCO packets\nwhich can be done with the hci.h constant SCO_ESCO_MASK.\n\nThis patch is motivated by broken Bluetooth carkits such as the Motorolo\nHF850 (it claims to support eSCO but will actually reject eSCO connections\nafter 5 seconds) and the 2007/2008 Infiniti G35/37 (fails to route audio\nif a 2-EV5 packet type is negiotiated). With this patch userspace can maintain\na list of compatible packet types to workaround remote devices such as these.\n\nBased on a patch by Marcel Holtmann.\n\nChange-Id: I304d8fda5b4145254820a3003820163bf53de5a5\nSigned-off-by: Nick Pelly \u003cnpelly@google.com\u003e\n

The exact conditions are difficult\nto reproduce but appear to occur during VFP exception handling when a\ntask causes a VFP exception which is handled via VFP_bounce and is then\npreempted by yet another task which in turn causes yet another VFP\nexception.  Since the VFP_bounce code is not preempt safe VFP state then\nbecomes corrupt.  In order to prevent preemption from occuring while\nhandling a VFP exception this patch disables preemption while handling\nVFP exceptions.\n\nSigned-off-by: George G.

465,Translator 1.1 conformance: fix ARRAY related gets\n\nThere is a set of glGets which query the client state of the\nbinded arrays. The data exists in the translator context and is not\npassed to GL so the glGets should be handled internaly.\nThis is done by implementing four glGet*v methods in GLEScontext which\nreturn a boolean value indicating whether we have set the return value\nor not and are called by the glGet*v functions in GLEScmImp.\nTwo of the glGets are handled by GLEScontext and the other 15 by\nGLEScmContext since they are specific to GLES 1.1. The same should be\ndone for 2.0 specific glGets in a later patch.\nAlso. bufferName is now saved in GLESPointer in to allow the\nGL_*_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING get.\n
466,Translator: fix eglGetProcAddress() on Linux\n\nOur implementation of eglGetProcAddress() resolves the function addresses\nin run time. Typically this is not an issue but when a gl function is\nalso implemented by the calling app the address was resolved to the calling\napp\u0027s version of the function rather than ours. This is the case with the\nglDrawTex{isfx}OES functions in the 1.1 conformance test.\nThe solution is to add the -Bsymbolic switch when linking our libraries\nso all symbol resolution is done internaly.\nThe same fix should probably be done for Mac.\n
467,1.1 Translator conformance: fix texture issues\n\nThis fixes three issues:\n\n1. glGet(GL_2d_TEXTURE_BINDING) should be handled by the translator rather\nthan by OpenGL.\n\n2. glIsTexture shoud return GL_TRUE only if the texture was bound at some\npoint - add a wasBound member to the TextureData and maintain it.\n\n3. glTexParameter(GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP) did not work. The first problem was\nthat it was not allowed by our validator - fixed. The next issue is that\nthis enum is not necessarily supported by the OpenGL implementation - it\nis in OpenGL 2.x but was replaced by an extension in 3.x. So in case the\nextension does not exist and GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP is required save this info\nin a new requiresAutoMipmap member of TextureData and call glGenerateMipmapExt\nwhenever glTex(Sub)Image2D is called.\nThere is a theoretical case where neither GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP nor glGenerateMipmap\nis supported by the OpenGL implementation - this is not likely to happen but\nif we find such an implementation it might require implementing a mipmap\ngeneration software algorithm (which is bad).\n

472,1.1 Translator: fix drawing of GL_POINT_SIZE_ARRAY\n\nWhen translating point size arrays from GLES to GL an optimization\nwas implemented where all points of the same size in an array or elements\narray where drawn together. This is wrong since it means points\nare not drawn in the order the app has requested creating the wrong\nresult when points in the array are overlapping in screen space.\nSo removed this mechanism and now just drawing the points in the right\norder.\nSome optimization is still there where if there are several\nconsecutive points of the same size they are drawn together.\n\nThe change in GLEScmImp.cpp is only to make the condition more readable -\nthe functionality is identical.\n

518,firewire: ohci: fix race in AR split packet handling\n\ncommit a1f805e5e73a8fe166b71c6592d3837df0cd5e2e upstream.\n\nWhen handling an AR buffer that has been completely filled we assumed\nthat its descriptor will not be read by the controller and can be\noverwritten.  However when the last received packet happens to end at\nthe end of the buffer the controller might not yet have moved on to the\nnext buffer and might read the branch address later.  If we overwrite\nand free the page before that the DMA context will either go dead\nbecause of an invalid Z value or go off into some random memory.\n\nTo fix this ensure that the descriptor does not get overwritten by\nusing only the actual buffer instead of the entire page for reassembling\nthe split packet.  Furthermore to avoid freeing the page too early\nmove on to the next buffer only when some data in it guarantees that the\ncontroller has moved on.\n\nThis should eliminate the remaining firewire-net problems.\n\nSigned-off-by: Clemens Ladisch \u003cclemens@ladisch.de\u003e\nTested-by: Maxim Levitsky \u003cmaximlevitsky@gmail.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Stefan Richter \u003cstefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

Ideally it should be a per project setting or ever\nbetter a launch configuration option but this is a bigger scope\nwe can implement later.\n\nThere are also a few fixes to make Proguard work under Windows:\n- the proguard.bat can only pass 9 args but we have 15+ so\n  we\u0027ll use a temporary proguard config file for Windows.\n- PROGUARD_HOME needs to be defined properly since the default\n  proguard.bat cannot infer it properly. We need other fixes\n  to that batch file so eventually we\u0027re not going to ship the\n  default one and we can fix the .bat file but properly defining\n  this env var is probably a good idea anyway.\n\nChange-Id: Ic18c6318eeb0310137fde13554664a746fb847e7\n

Read/write activity on the next\nboot to save away the apanic dump is moved from the dedicated driver\nto userspace.  (MTD erase continues to be performed by the dedicated\ndriver since this continues to not be harmful and the Android\nuserspace does not currently provide an MTD erase utility).\n\n/proc/apanic_console and /proc/apanic_threads are replaced by\n/proc/apanic and /proc/apanic-reset which can be read and\nwritten by userspace to find how to access the the apanic dump\ndevice.  The current interface is shell script friendly (in order\nto avoid shared kernel/userspace header files and because nandread\nis useful to leverage for reading dumps on MTD).  The script writes\nthe apanic header to the kernel driver which interprets the header\nand tells the script at which offsets and lengths to read the\nconsole and thread dump logs.\n\nChange-Id: I4a6b0125f74b82033ab0a73c1d108655d5f8fb53\nSigned-off-by: Todd Poynor \u003ctoddpoynor@google.com\u003e\n

When this function is performed on a\necryptfs filesystem the \u0027security\u0027 field is not updated for the lower\nfilesystem since the call security_inode_post_setxattr() is missing for\nthe lower inode.\nFurther the call security_inode_setxattr() is missing for the lower inode\nleading to policy violations in the security module because specific\nchecks for this hook are not performed (i. e. filesystem\n\u0027associate\u0027 permission on SELinux is not checked for the lower filesystem).\n\nThis patch replaces the call of the setxattr() method of the lower inode\nin the function ecryptfs_setxattr() with vfs_setxattr().\n\nSigned-off-by: Roberto Sassu \u003croberto.sassu@polito.it\u003e\nCc: Dustin Kirkland \u003ckirkland@canonical.com\u003e\nAcked-by: James Morris \u003cjmorris@namei.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Tyler Hicks \u003ctyhicks@linux.vnet.ibm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

There might be processes\nwaiting in tty_read-\u003en_tty_read on tty-\u003eread_wait for input to appear\nand at that moment a change of ldisc is fatal. n_tty_close is called\nit frees read_buf and the waiting process is still in the middle of\nreading and goes nuts after it is woken.\n\nPreviously we prevented close to happen when others are in ldisc ops\nby tty_ldisc_wait_idle in tty_set_ldisc. But the commit above removed\nthat. So revoke the change and test whether there is 1 user (\u003dwe) and\nallow the close then.\n\nWe can do that without ldisc/tty locks because nobody else can open\nthe device due to TTY_LDISC_CHANGING bit set so we in fact wait for\neverybody to leave.\n\nI don\u0027t understand why tty_ldisc_lock would be needed either when the\ncounter is an atomic variable so this is a lockless\ntty_ldisc_wait_idle.\n\nOn the other hand if we fail to wait (timeout or signal) we have to\nreenable the halted ldiscs so we take ldisc lock and reuse the setup\npath at the end of tty_set_ldisc.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jiri Slaby \u003cjslaby@suse.cz\u003e\nAcked-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nTested-by: Sebastian Andrzej Siewior \u003cbigeasy@breakpoint.cc\u003e\nLKML-Reference: \u003c20101031104136.GA511@Chamillionaire.breakpoint.cc\u003e\nLKML-Reference: \u003c1287669539-22644-1-git-send-email-jslaby@suse.cz\u003e\nCc: Alan Cox \u003calan@linux.intel.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

607,"TTY: don\u0027t allow reopen when ldisc is changing\n\ncommit e2efafbf139d2bfdfe96f2901f03189fecd172e4 upstream.\n\nThere are many WARNINGs like the following reported nowadays:\nWARNING: at drivers/tty/tty_io.c:1331 tty_open+0x2a2/0x49a()\nHardware name: Latitude E6500\nModules linked in:\nPid: 1207 comm: plymouthd Not tainted 2.6.37-rc3-mmotm1123 #3\nCall Trace:\n [\u003cffffffff8103b189\u003e] warn_slowpath_common+0x80/0x98\n [\u003cffffffff8103b1b6\u003e] warn_slowpath_null+0x15/0x17\n [\u003cffffffff8128a3ab\u003e] tty_open+0x2a2/0x49a\n [\u003cffffffff810fd53f\u003e] chrdev_open+0x11d/0x146\n...\n\nThis means tty_reopen is called without TTY_LDISC set. For further\nconsiderations note tty_lock is held in tty_open. TTY_LDISC is cleared in:\n1) __tty_hangup from tty_ldisc_hangup to tty_ldisc_enable. During this\nsection tty_lock is held. However tty_lock is temporarily dropped in\nthe middle of the function by tty_ldisc_hangup.\n\n2) tty_release via tty_ldisc_release till the end of tty existence. If\ntty-\u003ecount \u003c\u003d 1 tty_lock is taken TTY_CLOSING bit set and then\ntty_ldisc_release called. tty_reopen checks TTY_CLOSING before checking\nTTY_LDISC.\n\n3) tty_set_ldisc from tty_ldisc_halt to tty_ldisc_enable. We:\n   * take tty_lock set TTY_LDISC_CHANGING put tty_lock\n   * call tty_ldisc_halt (clear TTY_LDISC) tty_lock is _not_ held\n   * do some other work\n   * take tty_lock call tty_ldisc_enable (set TTY_LDISC) put\n     tty_lock\n\nI cannot see how 2) can be a problem as there I see no race. OTOH 1)\nand 3) can happen without problems. This patch the case 3) by checking\nTTY_LDISC_CHANGING along with TTY_CLOSING in tty_reopen. 1) will be\nfixed in the following patch.\n\nNicely reproducible with two processes:\nwhile (1) {\n\tfd \u003d open(\/dev/ttyS1\"" O_RDWR);\n\tif (fd \u003c 0) {\n\t\twarn(\""open\"");\n\t\tcontinue;\n\t}\n\tclose(fd);\n}\n--------\nwhile (1) {\n        fd \u003d open(\""/dev/ttyS1\"" O_RDWR);\n        ld1 \u003d 0; ld2 \u003d 2;\n        while (1) {\n                ioctl(fd TIOCSETD \u0026ld1);\n                ioctl(fd TIOCSETD \u0026ld2);\n        }\n        close(fd);\n}\n\nSigned-off-by: Jiri Slaby \u003cjslaby@suse.cz\u003e\nReported-by: \u003cValdis.Kletnieks@vt.edu\u003e\nCc: Kyle McMartin \u003ckyle@mcmartin.ca\u003e\nCc: Alan Cox \u003calan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n"""

617,Fix data corruption when writing to Bluetooth socket\n\nWrites to Bluetooth sockets are handled by writeNative() in\nandroid_bluetooth_BluetoothSocket.cpp. This calls asocket_write()\nwhich is implemented in abort_socket.c.\n\nThis latter function sleeps until poll() indicates that the socket is\nwriteable then calls write() once returning the number of bytes\nwritten. However writeNative() just returns this byte count to the\ncaller; it\u0027s eventually ignored in BluetoothOutputStream.java. This\ndoesn\u0027t match the semantics of a Java OutputStream which is required\nto block until all bytes have been written.\n\nThis fix adds a loop to writeNative() that repeatedly calls the lower\nlevel write function until all the data has been written (or an error\noccurred in which case we should exit the loop early). With this\nchange it is possible to write large amounts of data to a Bluetooth\nsocket without experiencing data loss.\n\nChange-Id: I0b464382817e15adec32ba0e3cb37e7d1cccc730\n

651,"mm page-allocator: do not check the state of a non-existant buddy during free\n\ncommit b7f50cfa3630b6e079929ffccfd442d65064ee1f upstream.\n\nThere is a bug in commit 6dda9d55 (\page allocator: reduce fragmentation\nin buddy allocator by adding buddies that are merging to the tail of the\nfree lists\"") that means a buddy at order MAX_ORDER is checked for merging.\n A page of this order never exists so at times an effectively random\npiece of memory is being checked.\n\nAlan Curry has reported that this is causing memory corruption in\nuserspace data on a PPC32 platform (http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/9/32).\nIt is not clear why this is happening.  It could be a cache coherency\nproblem where pages mapped in both user and kernel space are getting\ndifferent cache lines due to the bad read from kernel space\n(http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/13/179).  It could also be that there are\nsome special registers being io-remapped at the end of the memmap array\nand that a read has special meaning on them.  Compiler bugs have been\nruled out because the assembly before and after the patch looks relatively\nharmless.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem by ensuring we are not reading a possibly\ninvalid location of memory.  It\u0027s not clear why the read causes corruption\nbut one way or the other it is a buggy read.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mel Gorman \u003cmel@csn.ul.ie\u003e\nCc: Corrado Zoccolo \u003cczoccolo@gmail.com\u003e\nReported-by: Alan Curry \u003cpacman@kosh.dhis.org\u003e\nCc: KOSAKI Motohiro \u003ckosaki.motohiro@jp.fujitsu.com\u003e\nCc: Christoph Lameter \u003ccl@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nCc: Rik van Riel \u003criel@redhat.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton \u003cakpm@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n"""

If the current cpufreq policy does not include\nSLEEP_FREQ cpufreq_driver_target() does not change the cpu frequency\nfor power suspend resulting in crashes. This patch modifies the\ncurrent cpufreq policy to include SLEEP_FREQ for suspend and\nrestores the cpufreq policy after suspend.\n\nSigned-off-by: Michael Huang \u003cmike.g.huang@gmail.com\u003e\n

730,Add support for multiple hyperlink targets\n\nThis changeset makes the Go To Declaration hyperlink resolver produce\na list of possible jump targets. Therefore if you for example point\nat @android:string/ok you will get a popup listing all the various\nstring.xml files that define a translation for this string. If there\nis a current configuration (which would be the case if you are\npointing at a resource url from a layout file but not from a Java\nfile or a manifest file) then the declaration which best matches the\nconfiguration is listed first followed by everything else in\nalphabetical order by the folder name.\n\nThis uses the resource maps which the IDE is already maintaining for\nrendering so it can compute the set of hyperlinks cheaply.\n\nIn addition the hyperlink resolver now goes to the direct declaration\nof the given resource. This definition can in turn reference another\nresource url.\n\nThere is one exception to the instant resolution of files: ids. In\nlayouts it\u0027s common to define ids in place (via @+id) and these are\nnot available in the resource map. Therefore if no id is found\ndefined in a value folder then the search is deferred until the link\nis actually clicked. The search will now search not just the base\nlayout folder but all layout folders starting with the same folder\nas the link source followed by all configuration-compatible folders\nfollowed by all folders.\n\nChange-Id: I20fd4f5836e41e5a9839124b7be3a3230f5198f4\n
731,ARM architecture reference manuals for ARMv6 \u0026 ARMv7 state that the use of \u0027swp\u0027 instruction is deprecated\nARMv6 onwards. These architectures provide the load-linked store-conditional pair of ldrex/strex whose use\nis recommended in place of \u0027swp\u0027. Also the description of the \u0027swp\u0027 instruction in the ARMv6 reference\nmanual states that the swap operation does not include any memory barrier guarantees.This fix attempts to\naddress these issues by providing an atomic swap implementation using ldrex/strex under _ARM_HAVE_LDREX_STREX\nmacro. _ARM_HAVE_LDREX_STREX macro is defined in  cpu-features.h file and patch is submitted under change ID 11088.\nThis Fix is verified on ST Ericsson\u0027s U8500 platform and Submitted on behalf of a third-party:\nSurinder-pal SINGH from STMicroelectronics.\n

This could be used in those scenarios:\n\n - Exploiting a NULL pointer dereference issue in a setuid root binary\n - Bypassing the mmap_min_addr restrictions of the Linux kernel: by\n   running a setuid binary that would drop privileges before giving us\n   control back (for instance by loading a user-supplied library) we\n   could get the first page mapped in a process we control.  By further\n   using mremap and mprotect on this mapping we can then completely\n   bypass the mmap_min_addr restrictions.\n\nLess importantly we believe ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT should also be added\nsince on x86 32bits it will in practice disable most of the address\nspace layout randomization (only the stack will remain randomized).\n\nSigned-off-by: Julien Tinnes \u003cjt@cr0.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Tavis Ormandy \u003ctaviso@sdf.lonestar.org\u003e\nCc: stable@kernel.org\nAcked-by: Christoph Hellwig \u003chch@infradead.org\u003e\nAcked-by: Kees Cook \u003ckees@ubuntu.com\u003e\nAcked-by: Eugene Teo \u003ceugene@redhat.com\u003e\n[ Shortened lines and fixed whitespace as per Christophs\u0027 suggestion ]\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: San Mehat \u003csan@google.com\u003e\n

This could be used in those scenarios:\n\n - Exploiting a NULL pointer dereference issue in a setuid root binary\n - Bypassing the mmap_min_addr restrictions of the Linux kernel: by\n   running a setuid binary that would drop privileges before giving us\n   control back (for instance by loading a user-supplied library) we\n   could get the first page mapped in a process we control.  By further\n   using mremap and mprotect on this mapping we can then completely\n   bypass the mmap_min_addr restrictions.\n\nLess importantly we believe ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT should also be added\nsince on x86 32bits it will in practice disable most of the address\nspace layout randomization (only the stack will remain randomized).\n\nSigned-off-by: Julien Tinnes \u003cjt@cr0.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Tavis Ormandy \u003ctaviso@sdf.lonestar.org\u003e\nCc: stable@kernel.org\nAcked-by: Christoph Hellwig \u003chch@infradead.org\u003e\nAcked-by: Kees Cook \u003ckees@ubuntu.com\u003e\nAcked-by: Eugene Teo \u003ceugene@redhat.com\u003e\n[ Shortened lines and fixed whitespace as per Christophs\u0027 suggestion ]\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\n

It disables\nSuperSpeed terminations which means that devices will never connect at\nSuperSpeed on that port.

That\u0027s\nnot true with USB 3.0 ports.\n\nDo not let the USB core disable SuperSpeed ports.  We can\u0027t rely on the\ndevice speed in the port status registers since that isn\u0027t valid until\nthere\u0027s a USB device connected to the port.

Those describe the protocol port offset in\nthe PORTSC registers and port count.  We use those registers to create\ntwo arrays of pointers to the PORTSC registers one for USB 3.0 ports and\nanother for USB 2.0 ports.  A third array keeps track of the port protocol\nmajor revision and is indexed with the internal xHCI port number.\n\nThis commit is a bit big but it should be queued for stable because the \""Don\u0027t\nlet the USB core disable SuperSpeed ports\"" patch depends on it.

I have seen that the reset-device\nand configure-endpoint commands which are invoked from\nxhci_discover_or_reset_device() and xhci_configure_endpoint() will sometimes\ntime out.\n\nAfter much debugging I determined that the commands themselves do not actually\ntime out but rather their completion events do not get delivered to the right\nplace.\n\nThis happens when the command ring has just wrapped around and it\u0027s enqueue\npointer is left pointing to the link TRB. xhci_discover_or_reset_device() and\nxhci_configure_endpoint() use the enqueue pointer directly as their command\nTRB pointer without checking whether it\u0027s pointing to the link TRB.\n\nWhen the completion event arrives if the command TRB is pointing to the link\nTRB the check against the command ring dequeue pointer in\nhandle_cmd_in_cmd_wait_list() fails so the completion inside the command does\nnot get signaled.\n\nThe patch below fixes the timeout problem for me.\n\nThis should be queued for the 2.6.35 and 2.6.36 stable trees.\n\nSigned-off-by: Paul Zimmerman \u003cpaulz@synopsys.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Sarah Sharp \u003csarah.a.sharp@linux.intel.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

Unfortunately this -EINVAL causes X not to start.  Looking into\ndmesg there\u0027s a complaint like so:\n\nprocess \""Xorg\"" tried to map 0x01000000 bytes at page 0x00000000 on 0000:07:00.0 BAR 0 (start 0x        96000000 size 0x         1000000)\n\n...with the following code in pci_mmap_fits:\n\n\tpci_start \u003d (mmap_api \u003d\u003d PCI_MMAP_SYSFS) ?\n\t\tpci_resource_start(pdev resno) \u003e\u003e PAGE_SHIFT : 0;\n        if (start \u003e\u003d pci_start \u0026\u0026 start \u003c pci_start + size \u0026\u0026\n                        start + nr \u003c\u003d pci_start + size)\n\nIt looks like the logic here is set up such that when the mmap call comes via\nsysfs the check in pci_mmap_fits wants vma-\u003evm_pgoff to be between the\nresource\u0027s start and end address and the end of the vma to be no farther than\nthe end.  However the sysfs PCI resource files always start at offset zero\nwhich means that this test always fails for programs that mmap the sysfs files.\nGiven the comment in the original commit\n3b519e4ea618b6943a82931630872907f9ac2c2b I _think_ the old procfs files\nrequire that the file offset be equal to the resource\u0027s base address when\nmmapping.\n\nI think what we want here is for pci_start to be 0 when mmap_api \u003d\u003d\nPCI_MMAP_PROCFS.

This may lead to false negatives in pci_mmap_fits() which\nimplicitly assumes the /sys/bus/pci/devices layout.\n\n2. The loop in proc_bus_pci_mmap doesn\u0027t skip empty resouces. This leads\nto false positives because pci_mmap_fits() doesn\u0027t treat empty resources\ncorrectly (the calculated size is 1 \u003c\u003c (8*sizeof(resource_size_t)-PAGE_SHIFT)\nin this case!).\n\n3. If a user maps resources with BAR \u003e 0 pci_mmap_fits will emit bogus\nWARNINGS for the first resources that don\u0027t fit until the correct one is found.\n\nOn many controllers the first 2-4 BARs are used and the others are empty.\nIn this case an mmap attempt will first fail on the non-empty BARs\n(including the \right\"" BAR because of 1.) and emit bogus WARNINGS because\nof 3. and finally succeed on the first empty BAR because of 2.\nThis is certainly not the intended behaviour.\n\nThis patch addresses all 3 issues.\nUpdated with an enum type for the additional parameter for pci_mmap_fits().\n\nSigned-off-by: Martin Wilck \u003cmartin.wilck@ts.fujitsu.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Jesse Barnes \u003cjbarnes@virtuousgeek.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n"""

1153,USB: EHCI: fix obscure race in ehci_endpoint_disable\n\ncommit 02e2c51ba3e80acde600721ea784c3ef84da5ea1 upstream.\n\nThis patch (as1435) fixes an obscure and unlikely race in ehci-hcd.\nWhen an async URB is unlinked the corresponding QH is removed from\nthe async list.  If the QH\u0027s endpoint is then disabled while the URB\nis being given back ehci_endpoint_disable() won\u0027t find the QH on the\nasync list causing it to believe that the QH has been lost.  This\nwill lead to a memory leak at best and quite possibly to an oops.\n\nThe solution is to trust usbcore not to lose track of endpoints.  If\nthe QH isn\u0027t on the async list then it doesn\u0027t need to be taken off\nthe list but the driver should still wait for the QH to become IDLE\nbefore disabling it.\n\nIn theory this fixes Bugzilla #20182.  In fact the race is so rare\nthat it\u0027s not possible to tell whether the bug is still present.\nHowever adding delays and making other changes to force the race\nseems to show that the patch works.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alan Stern \u003cstern@rowland.harvard.edu\u003e\nReported-by: Stefan Richter \u003cstefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de\u003e\nCC: David Brownell \u003cdavid-b@pacbell.net\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

This means\nthat a card change can be detected without having to call\nmmc_detect_change multiple times.\n\nThis change generalises the core such that it can be easily used by\nhosts which provide a mechanism to detect only the presence of a card\nreader cover which has to be taken off in order to insert a card. Other\nhosts (\card detect\"" or \""MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL\"") each receive an event when\na card is removed and when a card is inserted so it is sufficient for\nthem if mmc_rescan handles only one event at a time. \""Cover detect\""\nhosts however only receive events about the cover status. This means\nthat between 2 subsequent events both a card removal and a card\ninsertion can occur. In this case the pre-patch version of mmc_rescan\nwould only detect the removal of the previous card but not the insertion\nof the new card.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jorg Schummer \u003cext-jorg.2.schummer@nokia.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Pierre Ossman \u003cpierre@ossman.eu\u003e\nSigned-off-by: San Mehat \u003csan@android.com\u003e\n\nConflicts:\n\n\tdrivers/mmc/core/core.c\n\nSigned-off-by: San Mehat \u003csan@google.com\u003e\n"""

This mode is used for example when changing\norientation to show all the changes at once. Currently overlay changes\nare still sent to the overlay device when surface flinger is frozen\nwhich causes the overlays to be updated significantly before the UI in\nfor example orientation changes. By deferring the overlay changes till\nsurface flinger is unfrozen a better result is achieved.\n\nChange-Id: I9e8cd9c3d0043a203a27b3539481c513f7a1739f\nSigned-off-by: Johan Mossberg \u003cjohan.xx.mossberg@stericsson.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Christian Bejram \u003cchristian.bejram@stericsson.com\u003e\n

1232,Bluetooth: Allow SCO/eSCO packet type selection for outgoing SCO connections.\n\n__u16 sco_pkt_type is introduced to struct sockaddr_sco. It allows bitwise\nselection of SCO/eSCO packet types. Currently those bits are:\n\n0x0001 HV1 may be used.\n0x0002 HV2 may be used.\n0x0004 HV3 may be used.\n0x0008 EV3 may be used.\n0x0010 EV4 may be used.\n0x0020 EV5 may be used.\n0x0040 2-EV3 may be used.\n0x0080 3-EV3 may be used.\n0x0100 2-EV5 may be used.\n0x0200 3-EV5 may be used.\n\nThis is similar to the Packet Type parameter in the HCI Setup Synchronous\nConnection Command except that we are not reversing the logic on the EDR bits.\nThis makes the use of sco_pkt_tpye forward portable for the use case of\nwhite-listing packet types which we expect will be the primary use case.\n\nIf sco_pkt_type is zero or userspace uses the old struct sockaddr_sco\nthen the default behavior is to allow all packet types.\n\nPacket type selection is just a request made to the Bluetooth chipset and\nit is up to the link manager on the chipset to negiotiate and decide on the\nactual packet types used. Furthermore when a SCO/eSCO connection is eventually\nmade there is no way for the host stack to determine which packet type was used\n(however it is possible to get the link type of SCO or eSCO).\n\nsco_pkt_type is ignored for incoming SCO connections. It is possible\nto add this in the future as a parameter to the Accept Synchronous Connection\nCommand however its a little trickier because the kernel does not\ncurrently preserve sockaddr_sco data between userspace calls to accept().\n\nThe most common use for sco_pkt_type will be to white-list only SCO packets\nwhich can be done with the hci.h constant SCO_ESCO_MASK.\n\nThis patch is motivated by broken Bluetooth carkits such as the Motorolo\nHF850 (it claims to support eSCO but will actually reject eSCO connections\nafter 5 seconds) and the 2007/2008 Infiniti G35/37 (fails to route audio\nif a 2-EV5 packet type is negiotiated). With this patch userspace can maintain\na list of compatible packet types to workaround remote devices such as these.\n\nBased on a patch by Marcel Holtmann.\n\nRebased to 2.6.39.\n\nChange-Id: Ide1c89574fa4f6f1b9218282e1af17051eb86315\nSigned-off-by: Nick Pelly \u003cnpelly@google.com\u003e\n

Currently those bits are:\n\n0x0001 HV1 may be used.\n0x0002 HV2 may be used.\n0x0004 HV3 may be used.\n0x0008 EV3 may be used.\n0x0010 EV4 may be used.\n0x0020 EV5 may be used.\n0x0040 2-EV3 may be used.\n0x0080 3-EV3 may be used.\n0x0100 2-EV5 may be used.\n0x0200 3-EV5 may be used.\n\nThis is similar to the Packet Type parameter in the HCI Setup Synchronous\nConnection Command except that we are not reversing the logic on the EDR bits.\nThis makes the use of sco_pkt_tpye forward portable for the use case of\nwhite-listing packet types which we expect will be the primary use case.\n\nIf sco_pkt_type is zero or userspace uses the old struct sockaddr_sco\nthen the default behavior is to allow all packet types.\n\nPacket type selection is just a request made to the Bluetooth chipset and\nit is up to the link manager on the chipset to negiotiate and decide on the\nactual packet types used. Furthermore when a SCO/eSCO connection is eventually\nmade there is no way for the host stack to determine which packet type was used\n(however it is possible to get the link type of SCO or eSCO).\n\nsco_pkt_type is ignored for incoming SCO connections. It is possible\nto add this in the future as a parameter to the Accept Synchronous Connection\nCommand however its a little trickier because the kernel does not\ncurrently preserve sockaddr_sco data between userspace calls to accept().\n\nThe most common use for sco_pkt_type will be to white-list only SCO packets\nwhich can be done with the hci.h constant SCO_ESCO_MASK.\n\nThis patch is motivated by broken Bluetooth carkits such as the Motorolo\nHF850 (it claims to support eSCO but will actually reject eSCO connections\nafter 5 seconds) and the 2007/2008 Infiniti G35/37 (fails to route audio\nif a 2-EV5 packet type is negiotiated). With this patch userspace can maintain\na list of compatible packet types to workaround remote devices such as these.\n\nBased on a patch by Marcel Holtmann.\n\nRebased to 2.6.39.\n\nChange-Id: Ie57e3da48759fa0c7a961629d953a2e179f3a5a3\nSigned-off-by: Nick Pelly \u003cnpelly@google.com\u003e\n

1370,"Add support for dynamic resource redirection.\n\nThis change supports resource redirection by either system or user\ninstalled theme packages which affect the final asset delivered to\napplications.  Theme packages can redirect assets from either the\nframework or other third party packages.  For instance assets in the\nlauncher or in the contacts app can be themed by any third party theme.\n\nTheme packages differ from regular application packages in their\nmanifest structure with an additional meta data XML format that states\nthe explicit resource redirections to be looked up by name at runtime.\nBecause theme packages coexist in the same AssetManager as regular\npackages they are compiled in a different package scope (currently 0x0a)\nto avoid conflicts with the framework (0x01) and applications (0x7f).\n\nRedirections are maintained in a new system service whose sole purpose\nis to cache the resource id mappings in memory and provide it to\nindividual app processes on demand.  This cache speeds up asset manager\nconstruction when theming is required but is not persisted across\nreboots as the cost to construct each individual mapping is relatively\nlow.\n\nThemes can be swapped dynamically at runtime without the need for a\ndevice restart.  This is possible by attaching the current user theme to\nthe Configuration object which upon an unhandled change will trigger\nthe usual activity onDestroy/onCreate cycle.  Additionally the ResTable\nclass was modified to support dynamic updates of the attached asset\npaths (the old theme is removed and the newly applied theme is added\ndynamically).  Updates to some special areas of the system UI must be\nhandled individually like the status bar service as it does not have a\nconventional activity lifecycle.\n\nFinally this patch is supported by an application suite (with a\ncompatible license) that manages the installed packages and allows the\nuser to apply their preferred theme.  Though it is the primary intention\nof this feature to support user controllable themes it also enables\ndevice manufacturers to \skin\"" the default Android styles by simply\nproviding a default system theme and choosing not to offer the\napplication suite.\n\nMore information can be found at http://tmobile-themes.googlecode.com/.\n\nChange-Id: I6be0b58b77ea6236c812eb52d86e76c69186b00b\n"""

1384,"Palette previews with custom themes and other palette fixes\n\nPalette previews are rendered on top of the default theme\nbackground. For certain custom themes where a gradient or image is\nused this can look terrible since the preview images will include\nportions of the gradient or image.\n\nThis changeset improves this situation by taking advantage of\nlayoutlib 5\u0027s ability to override the background. It now uses theme\nresolution to find the background color and paints the previews with\nthe custom background override to force this color. In addition if\nthe theme background is not a color (but a gradient etc) it uses\nlayoutlib5\u0027s new render-drawable support to generate the background\nand it extracts a suitable color from it (currently the center\npixel.)\n\nThis fix also ensures that the foreground color (used to paint labels\nfor the widgets that cannot be rendered such as layouts) has a\nsuitable contrast with the background. After computing the background\nit computes the brightness and if the foreground and background\ndiffer less than 25% in brightness then the foreground color is\nforced to white or black depending on whether the background is light\nor dark.\n\nThis changeset also contains a bugfix for a palette initialization\nproblem where in some cases the palette could come up empty (because\nthe code which attempts to avoid doing extra work when reloadPalette\nis called repeatedly could be tricked by a scenario where the SDK\ntarget does not change but its \have target data\"" status did.)\n\nThe open palette category is now preserved across palette refreshes\n(which occur when you change palette modes or category/sorting\noptions along with theme and render target changes).\n\nFinally the changeset also turns off the new window decorations\n(system bar action bar etc) when generating preview images for both\npalette previews and for drag \u0026 drop.\n\nChange-Id: I8b8766ad45f2cb6a4a6b79a24c31ed0f08d1e826\n"""

The save area for\nthe clock comparator however only contains the upper most seven bytes\nof the former contents if valid.\nTherefore the machine check handler uses a store clock instruction to\nget the current time and writes that to the clock comparator register\nwhich in turn will generate an immediate timer interrupt.\nHowever within the lowcore the expected time of the next timer\ninterrupt is stored. If the interrupt happens before that time the\nhandler won\u0027t be called. In turn the clock comparator won\u0027t be\nreprogrammed and therefore the interrupt condition stays pending which\ncauses an interrupt loop until the expected time is reached.\n\nOn NOHZ machines this can result in unresponsive machines since the\ntime of the next expected interrupted can be a couple of days in the\nfuture.\n\nTo fix this just revalidate the clock comparator register with the\nexpected value.\nIn addition the special handling for udelay must be changed as well.\n\nSigned-off-by: Heiko Carstens \u003cheiko.carstens@de.ibm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Martin Schwidefsky \u003cschwidefsky@de.ibm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

1426,PM / Hibernate: Fix memory corruption related to swap\n\ncommit c9e664f1fdf34aa8cede047b206deaa8f1945af0 upstream.\n\nThere is a problem that swap pages allocated before the creation of\na hibernation image can be released and used for storing the contents\nof different memory pages while the image is being saved.  Since the\nkernel stored in the image doesn\u0027t know of that it causes memory\ncorruption to occur after resume from hibernation especially on\nsystems with relatively small RAM that need to swap often.\n\nThis issue can be addressed by keeping the GFP_IOFS bits clear\nin gfp_allowed_mask during the entire hibernation including the\nsaving of the image until the system is finally turned off or\nthe hibernation is aborted.  Unfortunately for this purpose\nit\u0027s necessary to rework the way in which the hibernate and\nsuspend code manipulates gfp_allowed_mask.\n\nThis change is based on an earlier patch from Hugh Dickins.\n\nSigned-off-by: Rafael J.

Because of this all the /proc/irq/XX/spurious file\nshows IRQ 0 information regardless of the IRQ number.\n\nTo fix the problem irq_spurious_proc_open() must pass on the\nappropreate data (IRQ number) to single_open().\n\nSigned-off-by: Kenji Kaneshige \u003ckaneshige.kenji@jp.fujitsu.com\u003e\nReviewed-by: Yong Zhang \u003cyong.zhang0@gmail.com\u003e\nLKML-Reference: \u003c4CF4B778.90604@jp.fujitsu.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Thomas Gleixner \u003ctglx@linutronix.de\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

1454,"nohz/s390: fix arch_needs_cpu() return value on offline cpus\n\ncommit 398812159e328478ae49b4bd01f0d71efea96c39 upstream.\n\nThis fixes the same problem as described in the patch \nohz: fix\nprintk_needs_cpu() return value on offline cpus\"" for the arch_needs_cpu()\nprimitive:\n\narch_needs_cpu() may return 1 if called on offline cpus. When a cpu gets\nofflined it schedules the idle process which before killing its own cpu\nwill call tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick().\nThat function in turn will call arch_needs_cpu() in order to check if the\nlocal tick can be disabled. On offline cpus this function should naturally\nreturn 0 since regardless if the tick gets disabled or not the cpu will be\ndead short after. That is besides the fact that __cpu_disable() should already\nhave made sure that no interrupts on the offlined cpu will be delivered anyway.\n\nIn this case it prevents tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() to call\nselect_nohz_load_balancer(). No idea if that really is a problem. However what\nmade me debug this is that on 2.6.32 the function get_nohz_load_balancer() is\nused within __mod_timer() to select a cpu on which a timer gets enqueued.\nIf arch_needs_cpu() returns 1 then the nohz_load_balancer cpu doesn\u0027t get\nupdated when a cpu gets offlined. It may contain the cpu number of an offline\ncpu. In turn timers get enqueued on an offline cpu and not very surprisingly\nthey never expire and cause system hangs.\n\nThis has been observed 2.6.32 kernels. On current kernels __mod_timer() uses\nget_nohz_timer_target() which doesn\u0027t have that problem. However there might\nbe other problems because of the too early exit tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick()\nin case a cpu goes offline.\n\nThis specific bug was indrocuded with 3c5d92a0 \""nohz: Introduce\narch_needs_cpu\"".\n\nIn this case a cpu hotplug notifier is used to fix the issue in order to keep\nthe normal/fast path small. All we need to do is to clear the condition that\nmakes arch_needs_cpu() return 1 since it is just a performance improvement\nwhich is supposed to keep the local tick running for a short period if a cpu\ngoes idle. Nothing special needs to be done except for clearing the condition.\n\nAcked-by: Peter Zijlstra \u003ca.p.zijlstra@chello.nl\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Heiko Carstens \u003cheiko.carstens@de.ibm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Martin Schwidefsky \u003cschwidefsky@de.ibm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n"""

When we hit this errata in stop case (sDMA drain did\nnot complete) at the coming start the sDMA will not going to be\noperational (it is still draining).\nThis leads to DMA stall condition.\nOn OMAP3 we can recover with sDMA channel reset it has been observed\nthat by introducing unrelated sDMA activity might also help (reading\nfrom MMC for example).\n\nThe same errata exists for OMAP2 where the suggestion is to disable the\nbuffering to avoid this type of error.\nOn OMAP3 the suggestion is to set sDMA to NoStandby before disabling\nthe channel and wait for the drain to finish than configure sDMA to\nSmartStandby again.\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Ujfalusi \u003cpeter.ujfalusi@nokia.com\u003e\nAcked-by: Jarkko Nikula \u003cjhnikula@gmail.com\u003e\nAcked-by : Santosh Shilimkar \u003csantosh.shilimkar@ti.com\u003e\nAcked-by : Manjunath Kondaiah G \u003cmanjugk@ti.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Tony Lindgren \u003ctony@atomide.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

1471,omap: dma: Fix buffering disable bit setting for omap24xx\n\ncommit 3e57f1626b5febe5cc99aa6870377deef3ae03cc upstream.\n\nAn errata workaround for omap24xx is not setting the buffering disable bit\n25 what is the purpose but channel enable bit 7 instead.\n\nBackground for this fix is the DMA stalling issue with ASoC omap-mcbsp\ndriver. Peter Ujfalusi \u003cpeter.ujfalusi@nokia.com\u003e has found an issue in\nrecording that the DMA stall could happen if there were a buffer overrun\ndetected by ALSA and the DMA was stopped and restarted due that. This\nproblem is known to occur on both OMAP2420 and OMAP3. It can recover on\nOMAP3 after dma free dma request and reconfiguration cycle. However on\nOMAP2420 it seems that only way to recover is a reset.\n\nProblem was not visible before the commit c12abc0. That commit changed that\nthe McBSP transmitter/receiver is released from reset only when needed. That\nis only enabled McBSP transmitter without transmission was able to prevent\nthis DMA stall problem in receiving side and underlying problem did not show\nup until now. McBSP transmitter itself seems to no be reason since DMA\nstall does not recover by enabling the transmission after stall.\n\nDebugging showed that there were a DMA write active during DMA stop time and\nit never completed even when restarting the DMA. Experimenting showed that\nthe DMA buffering disable bit could be used to avoid stalling when using\nsource synchronized transfers. However that could have performance hit and\nOMAP3 TRM states that buffering disable is not allowed for destination\nsynchronized transfers so subsequent patch will implement a method to\ncomplete DMA writes when stopping.\n\nThis patch is based on assumtion that complete lock-up on OMAP2420 is\ndifferent but related problem. I don\u0027t have access to OMAP2420 errata but\nI believe this old workaround here is put for a reason but unfortunately\na wrong bit was typed and problem showed up only now.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jarkko Nikula \u003cjhnikula@gmail.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Peter Ujfalusi \u003cpeter.ujfalusi@nokia.com\u003e\nAcked-by: Manjunath Kondaiah G \u003cmanjugk@ti.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Tony Lindgren \u003ctony@atomide.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

1484,cifs: fix parsing of hostname in dfs referrals\n\ncommit ba03864872691c0bb580a7fb47388da337ef4aa2 upstream.\n\nThe DFS referral parsing code does a memchr() call to find the \u0027\\\\\u0027\ndelimiter that separates the hostname in the referral UNC from the\nsharename. It then uses that value to set the length of the hostname via\npointer subtraction.  Instead of subtracting the start of the hostname\nhowever it subtracts the start of the UNC which causes the code to\npass in a hostname length that is 2 bytes too long.\n\nRegression introduced in commit 1a4240f4.\n\nReported-and-Tested-by: Robbert Kouprie \u003crobbert@exx.nl\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Jeff Layton \u003cjlayton@redhat.com\u003e\nCc: Wang Lei \u003cwang840925@gmail.com\u003e\nCc: David Howells \u003cdhowells@redhat.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Steve French \u003csfrench@us.ibm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

1508,Phone crash when old callback func is woken up when enabling BT.\n\nWhen the remote Jerry device is powered down the BT link to the\nphone is dropped and the Jerry firmware in the phone quite\nimmediately tries to re-connect to the Jerry device. Then\nSDP and Discover Services is started fetchRemoteUuids() -\u003e\ndiscoverServicesNative(). This results in an asynchronous dbus\ncall dbus_func_args_async()  that is provided with a callback\nfunction onDiscoverServicesResult() but before this callback\nfunction is used Bluetooth is disabled according to the problem\nscenario above. For some reason this discover services activity\nis not cleared when Bluetooth is disabled so when Bluetooth\nis enabled again the (old) callback function\nonDiscoverServicesResult() is executed but the following\ngetAddressFromObjectPath() fails. The reason for this is that\nthe deviceObjectPath parameter contains an old value\ncontaing the process id of the old bluetoothd (the one running\nbefore Bluetooth was disabled). Then the new updated\nAdapterObjectPath /org/bluez/\u003cnew bluetooth hd pid\u003e/hci0/dev_\nis not a prefix of the old deviceObjectPath /org/bluez/\u003cold\nbluetooth hd pid\u003e/hci0/dev_\u003cBT_ADDR\u003e which results in that null\nwill be used as address in sendUuidIntent() and later on\nending up in the BluetoothDevice constructor where and\nIllegalArgumentExceotion is thrown due to\nBluetooth address \u003d null. Then the phone will crash.\n\nMaking sure sendUuidIntent() is not called when address is null\nis a work-around for the problem.\n\nChange-Id: I8ff60bad80de3b379cef0970402943dfa4de3cfd\n

1517,ARM: 6489/1: thumb2: fix incorrect optimisation in usracc\n\ncommit 1142b71d85894dcff1466dd6c871ea3c89e0352c upstream.\n\nCommit 8b592783 added a Thumb-2 variant of usracc which when it is\ncalled with \\rept\u003d2 calls usraccoff once with an offset of 0 and\nsecondly with a hard-coded offset of 4 in order to avoid incrementing\nthe pointer again. If \\inc !\u003d 4 then we will store the data to the wrong\noffset from \\ptr. Luckily the only caller that passes \\rept\u003d2 to this\nfunction is __clear_user so we haven\u0027t been actively corrupting user data.\n\nThis patch fixes usracc to pass \\inc instead of #4 to usraccoff\nwhen it is called a second time.\n\nReported-by: Tony Thompson \u003ctony.thompson@arm.com\u003e\nAcked-by: Catalin Marinas \u003ccatalin.marinas@arm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Will Deacon \u003cwill.deacon@arm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Russell King \u003crmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

1526,Add test cases for concurrent gc and System.arraycopy\n\nWhen System.arraycopy runs at the same time as a concurrent gc\nthe phone will sometimes crash since System.arraycopy was implemented\nusing memmove and memcpy. In current implementation of mememove bytes\nare copied one at a time. If for instance only 3 out of 4 bytes\nto an object reference were copied when the thread switch to the\ngc thread occurred and the gc was scanning the marked objects the\ngc read an invalid address. The parameters to dvmWriteBarrierArray\nin one case was also corrected (they are currently not used).\n\nThe fix itself for this crash is made elsewhere this commit just\nadds test cases to verify that this works and that performance is\nacceptable.\n\nChange-Id: I0a8cfd43561b3d5de4bba818993bcf8b40413045\n

1545,Simplify core framebuffer management.\n\nRemove one layer of indirection between the core\u0027s DisplayState\nand a ProxyFramebuffer object. The main ideas behind this patch\nare that:\n\n- We don\u0027t need a QFrameBuffer object when in the core process\n  each proxy can receive display updates directly from QEMU.\n\n- The DisplayChangeListener is really lame: its can\u0027t dissociate\n  between several listeners that use the same callback pointers\n  so introduce DisplayUpdateListener in console.h to work around\n  this. This is preferably to modifying DisplayChangeListener\n  which is going to introduce conflicts with upstream.\n\n- Simplify a lot the console code and display-core. Note that\n  we can have several framebuffer clients at the same time now.\n\nNote that QFrameBuffer is still used by both the UI program and\nthe standalone emulator.\n\nChange-Id: I6d5ad6ecd9b34b9d9d1a30ea5000e875c285e84e\n

1603,do_exit(): make sure that we run with get_fs() \u003d\u003d USER_DS\n\ncommit 33dd94ae1ccbfb7bf0fb6c692bc3d1c4269e6177 upstream.\n\nIf a user manages to trigger an oops with fs set to KERNEL_DS fs is not\notherwise reset before do_exit().  do_exit may later (via mm_release in\nfork.c) do a put_user to a user-controlled address potentially allowing\na user to leverage an oops into a controlled write into kernel memory.\n\nThis is only triggerable in the presence of another bug but this\npotentially turns a lot of DoS bugs into privilege escalations so it\u0027s\nworth fixing.  I have proof-of-concept code which uses this bug along\nwith CVE-2010-3849 to write a zero to an arbitrary kernel address so\nI\u0027ve tested that this is not theoretical.\n\nA more logical place to put this fix might be when we know an oops has\noccurred before we call do_exit() but that would involve changing\nevery architecture in multiple places.\n\nLet\u0027s just stick it in do_exit instead.\n\n[akpm@linux-foundation.org: update code comment]\nSigned-off-by: Nelson Elhage \u003cnelhage@ksplice.com\u003e\nCc: KOSAKI Motohiro \u003ckosaki.motohiro@jp.fujitsu.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton \u003cakpm@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

The ADBd and other network services do not resume correctly.\n 2. Normal SD card usage is blocked since snapshots are written to a\n    qcow2 image that must (for now) be mounted on hda.\n 3. Resume only works after the emulator is fully booted. It is not\n    (yet) possible to load an image immediately after the machine\n    started.\n\nThe synchronous I/O code is ported from commit ef845c3b in mainline\nQEMU which addresses a similar issue. Further upstream mainline also\nintroduces a fix for the async I/O but that patch is quite involved\nand for now this relatively simple fix works.\n\nChange-Id: I660c19c22316aecdd7dcae357e66da20e0ab6d80\n

1921,Fix phone crash in BT MT call disconnect enable mute/hold in GSM.\n\nWhen phone is in global mode and acquires CDMA signal first it will start an\nOTA call. OTA variables get initiazed which are only valid in CDMA. On switching\nto GSM/UMTS these variables are not cleared. MUTE/HOLD options in InCallMenu are\nenabled/disabled based on these variables and hence MUTE/HOLD options are\ndisabled for normal GSM calls. Similarly while disconnecting the MT call in BT\nthe OTA vars are checked and some processing is done which leads to phone crash.\n\nTo fix these issues phone type is checked for CDMA before using OTA data. OTA\nvariables are cleaned up and call screen is cleaned up when there is a\nradio technology change.\n\nChange-Id: I7f2d3c8214e832c7423dedb4d0a3e4d27ec11068\n

1975,New SurfaceFlinger API to allow grabbing screen shots\n\nThis patch adds a new interface through which clients can obtain\nimages of the screen from the SurfaceFlinger. This is needed because\nreading directly from the frame buffer is unreliable on some\nplatforms.\n\nThe new entry point is\n\nstatus_t SurfaceComposerClient::grabScreen(DisplayID dpy int fd);\n\nTo use this API the client should create an ashmem region of the\ncorrect size (which it can calculate from the data returned by\ngetDisplayInfo) and pass the file descriptor to this function. The\ncall will fail unless the client has READ_FRAME_BUFFER permission.  It\nwill also fail if a surface with the SECURE flag set is visible.\n\nOn return the ashmem region will contain a copy of the current screen\nimage (in OpenGL row order).\n\nFuture patches will build on this API to provide more features such as\nincremental screen capturing (grabbing only changed regions rather\nthan the whole screen) and the ability to grab only parts of the\nscreen rather than the whole image.\n\nChange-Id: I51b6a43fb78b1df4194dc2f3c24058da382f5853\n

This patch was discussed here:\nhttp://marc.info/?l\u003dlinux-omap\u0026m\u003d125020395904977\u0026w\u003d2\n\nI have rebased this to the APG 2.6.29 kernel and made a minor change to make\nthis work on this kernel release. Details of this change are below.\n\nDepending on the OMAP3 boot mode the MUSB peripheral may or may not be\naccessible when the kernel starts.\n\nThe OMAP3 can boot from several devices including USB. The sequence of the\ndevices the OMAP will attempt to boot from is configured via the sys_boot\npins on the device. If USB is one of the devices the OMAP boot ROM attempts\nto boot from on power-on then the interface clock to the MUSB peripheral\nwill be enabled by the boot ROM and the MUSB peripheral will be accessible\nwhen the kernel boots. However if USB is not one of the devices OMAP\nattempts to boot from then the interface clock is not enabled and the MUSB\nperipheral will not be accessible on start-up.\n\nIf the MUSB peripheral is not accessible when the kernel boots then the\nkernel will crash when attempting to access the OTG_SYSCONFIG in the\nfunction musb_platform_init(). The actual cause of the crash is the write\nto the OTG_SYSCONFIG register in the function usb_musb_pm_init() to reset\nthe MUSB peripheral which occurs prior to calling musb_platform_init().\nThe function usb_musb_pm_init() does not check to see if the interface\nclock for the MUSB peripheral is enabled before writing to MUSB register.\nThis write access does not generate a data-abort at this point but because\nthis write does not complete all future accesses to the MUSB controller will\ngenerate data-aborts regardless of whether the interface clock has been\nenabled at a later stage. The only way I have found to recover from this is\nresetting the device. My understanding is that the interconnect works in\nthis way to prevent a bad access locking up the system.\n\nThis patch ensures the interface clock for the MUSB in the function\nusb_musb_pm_init() is enabled. This patch also ensures that the interface\nclock is disabled after the reset is complete. My reasoning for always\ndisabling the clock rather than maintaing its state is:\n\n1). If the MUSB peripheral is not being used then the interface clock should\nbe disabled.\n2). The musb_set_clock() function uses a static variable called \clk_on\"" to\ndetermine if the MUSB interface clock is on or off. On boot-up clk_on will\nbe 0 and so this function assumes that the clock is off by default which\nmay not be the case in the current code.\n\nI have also added a while-loop to wait for the reset of the MUSB module to\ncomplete before this function exits and the interface clock it disabled.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jon Hunter \u003cjon-hunter@ti.com\u003e\n"""

2079,musb: proper hookup to transceiver drivers\n\nI believe that a bug was introduced in the musb driver when the commit\na52fb3f41795722f1c4cbbdf628dc62cb4dc7d9d was integrated. This is simply\nfixed by back porting the commit 84e250ffa76dddc1bad84e04248a27f442c25986\nfrom David Brownell. A description of the bug follows.\n\nIn the file drivers/usb/otg/twl4030-usb.c the following functions are\npassed a pointer to the otg_transceiver structure:\n\nstatic int twl4030_set_suspend(struct otg_transceiver *x int suspend)\nstatic int twl4030_set_peripheral(struct otg_transceiver *x struct usb_gadget\n*gadget)\nstatic int twl4030_set_host(struct otg_transceiver *x struct usb_bus *host)\n\nThe structure otg_transceiver is stored in two places; one being in\nthe musb structure and the second being in the twl4030 transceiver\nstructure. Please note that in both the musb and twl4030_usb\nstructures the otg_transceiver member is defined simply as a struct\nand NOT a pointer to a struct.\n\nThe musb structure in drivers/usb/musb/musb_core.h defines:\n\nstruct musb {\n\t        ...\n\t\t        struct otg_transceiver  xceiv;\n\t\t\t        ...\n};\n\ntwl4030_usb structure in drivers/usb/otg/twl4030_usb.c defines:\n\nstruct twl4030_usb {\n\t        struct otg_transceiver  otg;\n\t\t        ...\n};\n\nThe address of the otg_transceiver pointer passed by the musb driver\nto the twl4030_set_xxx functions is location of the otg_transceiver\nmember within the musb structure. However the twl4030_set_xxx\nfunctions are attempting to resolve the address of the twl4030_usb\nstructure from this address by calling the following macro:\n\n #define xceiv_to_twl(x)         container_of((x) struct twl4030_usb otg);\n\nThis results in the incorrect address being used for the twl4030_usb\nstructure because the address passed is from within the musb structure\nand not the twl4030_usb structure.\n\nThe following is the original changelog from David Brownell\u0027s commit\n(84e250ffa76dddc1bad84e04248a27f442c25986):\n\nLet the otg_transceiver in MUSB be managed by an external driver;\ndon\u0027t assume it\u0027s integrated.  OMAP3 chips need it to be external\nand there may be ways to interact with the transceiver which add\nfunctionality to the system.\n\nPlatform init code is responsible for setting up the transeciver\nprobably using the NOP transceiver for integrated transceivers.\nExternal ones will use whatever the board init code provided\nsuch as twl4030 or something more hands-off.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Brownell \u003cdbrownell@users.sourceforge.net\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Jon Hunter \u003cjon-hunter@ti.com\u003e\n

2173,Add gesture support marquee selection and refactoring\n\nThis checkin adds support for gestures and overlays. Gestures are\nsessions of mouse/keyboard activity and this is documented in the\njavadoc for the new Gesture class. Overlays are units of graphics and\nthese are documented in the Overlay javadoc. The gesture architecture\nlets us isolate the logic for each different type of operation\n(marquee resize move etC) and with associated overlays we don\u0027t\nattempt to for example paint drag feedback during a resize operation\netc.\n\nThe checkin also adds marquee selection (as a second gesture in\naddition to the existing drag \u0026 drop based move gesture) along with\nsome associated changes in how the root view is treated.\n\nAs part of isolating the mouse handling and painting related to\ngestures painting etc. I also refactored the code quite a bit.\nLayoutCanvas which used to be a large class has been split into a\nnumber of new classes one for each area of responsibility:\n\n- The mouse listener and drag \u0026 drop code has been moved into a\n  GestureManager. (A lot of the\tdrop handling code also\tcame from the\n  CanvasDropListener class.)\n\n- Code related to maintaining the set of rendered views and\n  performing searches in the views has been moved into a\n  ViewHierarchy class.\n\n- Code related to selection has been moved into a SelectionManager.\n\n- Various individual painting pieces (outline hover etc) have been\n  moved into individual Overlay classes such as OutlineOverlay\n  HoverOverlay SelectionOverlay etc. This also moved associated\n  resource allocation and cleanup into the overlays.\n\n- New coordinate classes ControlPoint and LayoutPoint are used\n  instead of ints and plain Points to make it really clear which\n  methods require coordinates in the layout (such as the\n  ViewHieararchy search methods) and which ones require coordinates in\n  the canvas control (such as paint methods). There are factory methods\n  to automatically construct the right kind of coordinate from\n  different types of mouse events as well as methods to convert\n  between the two.\n\nI also tweaked the visual appearance of selection a bit more and\nsome other misc cleanup.\n\nChange-Id: I666aabdcd36720bebe406b68237e8966d985fb8f\n

2191,Fix XML editing whitespace handling\n\nThis changeset fixes three problems related to the way whitespace is\nhandled by the visual editor.\n\n(1) The editor would insert a newline text node after a newly inserted\nelement but this element was appended rather than inserted\nimmediately after the element which meant that if you inserted your\nelement anywhere in the *middle* of the child list you would\naccumulate blank lines at the end of the parent\u0027s element and have no\nseparator before the current element.\n\nThe fix is simple - use insertBefore() rather than appendChild() when\ninserting the new node.\n\n(2) On deletion no XML text nodes were deleted. This means that if\nyou inserted 4 elements then deleted them you would end up with 4\nblank text nodes.\n\nThe fix here is to look at the sibling when we are about to delete\nand if it looks like a pure whitespace node remove it as well.\n\n(3) When nested content (like a LinearLayout) was inserted there\nwould be no newline inserted before the child so that first element\nwould end up on the same line as the parent.\n\nThe fix here is to detect this scenario (when we are inserting an\nelement into an element that has no children) and insert a newline\n*before* the element (as well as after as is the case for all newly\ninserted elements).\n\nLonger term we should do more advanced things with formatting such as\nindenting nested content and making sure that when we insert and\nremove whitespace nodes we always adjust the indentation\ncorrectly. But for now this changeset makes the XML generated by the\neditor much more readable and consistent.\nChange-Id: I2e65152568092a775074a606e3f5e54c680611c6\n

2432,Bluetooth: Add SCO fallback for eSCO connection attempts\n\nWhen attempting to setup eSCO connections it can happen that some link\nmanager implementations fail to properly negotiate the eSCO parameters\nand thus fail the eSCO setup. Normally the link manager is responsible\nfor the negotiation of the parameters and actually fallback to SCO if\nno agreement can be reached. In cases where the link manager is just too\nstupid then at least try to establish a SCO link if eSCO fails.\n\nFor the Bluetooth devices with EDR support this includes handling packet\ntypes of EDR basebands. This is particular tricky since for the EDR the\nlogic of enabling/disabling one specific packet type is turned around.\nThis fix contains an extra bitmask to disable eSCO EDR packet when\ntrying to fallback to a SCO connection.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann \u003cmarcel@holtmann.org\u003e\n

Thumb-2 rocks!).\n\nNote that as an interesting side effect NEON machine code is generally\nslower than the equivalent C code it is supposed to replace when run inside\nthe emulator. This can be explained by the fact that for now the translator\nsimply translates each NEON instruction into a series of sequential host\ninstructions (and also requires over-head for packing/unpacking/saturation/\netc...).\n\nThis change has been tested by running the \full-eng\"" platform image\nrebuilt for ARMv7-A and Neon and using an appropriate kernel image\n(prebuilt/android-arm/kernel/kernel-qemu-armv7). The system could boot\nand seems to work perfectly. Not a single issue has been experienced\nduring testing.

It requires blending a single 32-bit\ncolour value into a 16-bit framebuffer.\nIt\u0027s used when fading out the screen eg. when a modal requester pops-up.\n\nThe PF JIT produces code for this using 24 instructions/pixel. The NEON\nimplementation requires 2.1 instructions/pixel.

2608,"READ_FRAME_BUFFER INJECT_EVENTS permissions to \u0027dangerous\u0027.\n\nThese permissions are those that are required to write a remote-control\nsolution for an Android device. Currently they\u0027re marked as\n\u0027signature\u0027 which I believe means no third-party can use them. This\npatch alters them to being \u0027dangerous\u0027 instead. This means third party\nsoftware can use them but a large warning will pop up explaining that\nthe user is compromising control of their device (again assuming I\u0027ve\nunderstood things right!)\n\nSome other points:\n\n- I have not amended the strings associated with these permissions\n  partly because they\u0027re OK and partly because it involves\n  translations. For what it\u0027s worth the en-GB strings are:\n    \u003cstring name\u003d\permlab_readFrameBuffer\""\u003e\""read frame buffer\""\u003c/string\u003e\n    \u003cstring name\u003d\""permdesc_readFrameBuffer\""\u003e\""Allows application to use\n       read the content of the frame buffer.\""\u003c/string\u003e\n    \u003cstring name\u003d\""permlab_injectEvents\""\u003e\""press keys and control\n       buttons\""\u003c/string\u003e\n    \u003cstring name\u003d\""permdesc_injectEvents\""\u003e\""Allows an application to\n       deliver its own input events (key presses etc.) to other\n       applications. Malicious applications can use this to take over\n       the phone.\""\u003c/string\u003e\n  I tend to think that the \u0027injectEvents\u0027 description is fine but the\n  \u0027readFrameBuffer\u0027 label and description should probably have \u0027frame\n  buffer\u0027 changed to \u0027screen\u0027 since non-techies tend not to know what\n  a frame buffer means. (Also it has two verbs in it.)\n\n  However if you agree I\u0027m still inclined to submit that as a\n  separate commit because I think the current text is probably good\n  enough for now and the latter patch will be complex as it will\n  involve translations. (Question: is there anyone in the Android\n  project who can help with translations or would the committer be\n  expected to patch each of the files?)\n\n- Currently there are no third-party-callable APIs which use the\n  READ_FRAME_BUFFER permission. The only way to use it is to arrange\n  to send a 1012 transaction code to the SurfaceFlinger which will\n  reply with a parcel containing the screen shot. Obviously this is\n  not an official API but it can be done through some minor hacks.\n  Obviously third-parties calling things this way raises\n  compatibility issues in the future. So I am preparing a separate\n  patch which will provide some more official API which \u0027officially\u0027\n  calls that transaction code.\n\n- The same sort of issues apply to event injection and again I\u0027ll\n  submit a separate patch.\n\n- I get the impression that the screenshotting stuff has been left in\n  SurfaceFlinger just for occasional use inside Google and was never\n  really intended to be made publicly-accessible. You may therefore\n  want to reject this patch on the grounds that it\u0027s exposing internal\n  functionality which you don\u0027t want to expose. I could understand\n  that. But I\u0027d be really grateful if you can find some other\n  \u0027recommended\u0027 way to grab screenshots short of becoming root and\n  snaffling /dev/graphics/fb0. Or if there\u0027s anything I can do to\n  spruce up the screenshot code let me know.\n\n- The screenshotting code does not allow a screenshot if there is a\n  \u0027secure\u0027 window on screen which presumably means DRM stuff. So that\n  should not be a concern about this change.\n\n- I have a couple of other patches in the pipeline which will:\n  (a) allow grabbing parts of the screen and\n  (b) provide an asynchronous callback to the client whenever the\n      screen changes.\n\n- As you can guess this is for a third-party remote-control product.\n  Specifically it\u0027s for a VNC server. Perhaps surprisingly many\n  people want to control their mobile devices. There are already a\n  couple of attempts at Android VNC servers - the one inside\n  SurfaceFlinger and http://code.google.com/p/android-vnc/. Neither\n  of these I believe will work on real devices so there is clearly a\n  need for a VNC server for testing purposes too.\n\n- I\u0027ve mentioned that I plan to submit several patches. I\u0027m assuming\n  you\u0027d like many small patches rather than one big one. But then\n  again it seemed best to send both permission changes together. Let\n  me know if I\u0027ve guessed wrong.\n"""
2609,"Fixing verb in permdesc_readFrameBuffer English.\n\nThere were too many verbs in this sentence. Ideally this patch should\nalso be applied to some of the other languages. German seems OK but\nFrench not - and that\u0027s as far as my linguistic abilities go. I\nhaven\u0027t fixed the French since I\u0027m only 99% sure I wouldn\u0027t mess it up!\n\nI chose \read\"" not \""use\"" because this permission does not allow\nwriting to the frame buffer; it currently only controls the\nscreenshotting functionality inside SurfaceFlinger.\n"""

2659,fix signature checking\n\nThis fix adds some flexibility to the platform signature checking\ncapability and also ensures that the behavior matches the comment\ninline.\n\nCurrently the platform documentation indicates that signatures must\nmatch exactly for applications to be upgraded. This limits scenarios\nlike transitioning the key used to sign a particular application. Error\ncodes when upgrading applications published to the market indicate that\napplications should have at least one signature in common not an exact\nmatch although the behavior of the market is different and matches the\npublished documentation. A common signature should be sufficient to\nsupport upgrade scenarios.\n\nMore importantly this change adds flexibility to signature-based\npermissions. Currently signatures must match exactly between the\ndeclaring and requesting applications for the successful granting of\npermissions. This limits how the declaring\napplication\u0027s signature-based permissions can be used. With this change\na common subset is required to ensure permissions are properly granted\nwhich should be sufficiently secure.\n\nChange-Id: Ib25c6ad69a02d3a1b121f4a7c5ef3b64eee3cb7e\n

For older versions of the layout library it can be handed\nhierarchies where the view cookies (which point back to XML model\nobjects corresponding to the rendered views) that are missing or\nambiguous.

2714,AI 148824: Fix issue #1851541 (sharedUserId requests not being checked for matching signatures on .apk).\n  To address issues where we could leave half-installed applications around if there was a failure during the install we split getPackageLP() into two phases: the first would create the record and only after doing all verification checks would we call insertPackageSettingLP() to do the remaining part of the original implementation and actually insert the record into the data structures.\n  Unfortunately it was only in insertPackageSettingLP() that we would set the sharedUser field of the PackageSetting structure so when before that we went to verify certificates we didn\u0027t think it had requested a shared user ID and let it through without checking.\n  This fix simply sets the sharedUser field when the PackageSetting structure is first created so we will actually check against its certs.  We still also set this again in insertPackageSettingLP() but there is no harm in this because the only time we call this function is in that big install func which just passes in the same shared user that it had when first getting the package.\n  BUG\u003d1851541\n\nAutomated import of CL 148824\n

During this phase a list of\n\t    weak references is created. A check is performed to ensure that\n\t    only references with a non-null referent are added to this list.\n\t    In most cases for the example above the referent will be null\n\t    at this point and it will never be added to the list. But if\n\t    the timing is extremely bad it looks like it is possible for the\n\t    reference to end up on the list before the referent has been set\n\t    to null and the referent is set to null a little while later.\n\t    This means that we now have a reference on the list with a null\n\t    referent.\n\n\t    A bit later in the garbage collection flow the list of weak\n\n\ts is traversed in order to clear the references that\n\t    can be collected. Here we got the crash because the code asserted\n\t    that the referent of the references in the list should be\n\t    non-null. And in some rare cases it actually was null. The fix\n\t    is simply to remove the assert.\n\n\tcommit ef4b0613d6952770aefac07d503955eb7b962d2b\n\tMerge: 464104b e9503ef\n\tAuthor: Andy McFadden \u003cfadden@android.com\u003e\n\tDate:   Mon Nov 8 19:38:19 2010 -0800\n\n\t    am e9503ef8: am 886130bc: (-s ours) Two patches.\n\n\t    * commit \u0027e9503ef8c460f4818062ecc80a9e0b4f8c6745b8\u0027:\n\t      Two patches.\n\nChange-Id: I04c1c9204af8197a4352358d805af40f1312d2ea\nSigned-off-by: Bruce Beare \u003cbruce.j.beare@intel.com\u003e\n"""
2789,"Pick layout themes from manifest registrations and target SDK\n\nThis changeset changes the way the layout editor picks themes when a\nlayout is opened. It used to just pick the first available theme in\nthe theme chooser.\n\nNow it performs the following checks in order:\n\n* Does this layout have a persisted theme setting from a previous run\n  of the tool? If yes use it.\n* Can the activity for this layout be determined? If so look at the\n  manifest registration for the corresponding activity and if it\n  specifies a theme use it.\n* If not does the manifest specify a default theme for the project?\n  If so use it.\n* If not is the target SDK version (or the minimum SDK version if\n  the target is not specified) at least API level 11 or higher? If so\n  the default theme is \Theme.Holo\""\n* If not the default theme is \""Theme\"".\n* If the file to be opened is included from some other layout use\n  the no-decorations versions of the default layouts e.g.\n  Theme.NoTitleBar or Theme.Holo.NoActionBar.\n* At the end of this resolution the computed theme is stored as the\n  persisted theme setting for this layout so the above algorithm will\n  only be computed once. We might want to tweak this such that it\n  distinguishes between a default computation of a theme and a manual\n  user choice of a theme.\n* If the file is opened as \""Show Included In\"" (e.g. rendered within an\n  outer file) then the theme chosen is the one for the outer file.\n\nDuring startup this information will be asked for each and every\nlayout being reopened so there is now a \""ManifestInfo\"" class attached\nto the project which keeps manifest information around. It checks the\ntimestamp of the AndroidManifest.xml file and refreshes its\ninformation lazily if necessary.\n\nAll themes mentioned in the manifest are listed in a special section\nat the top of the theme chooser (below the entry for the default\ncomputed described above).\n\nThe code to look up the associated Activity of a layout is using a\nsimple heuristic: it looks for usages of the corresponding R.layout\nfield and prefers references from methods called onCreate or in\nclasses whose superclass name ends with Activity. I tried a different\napproach where I searched for usages of Activity.setContentView(int)\nbut this failed to identify a number of cases where the activity was\ndoing some simple logic and didn\u0027t pass the layout id directly as a\nparameter in setContentView so I went back to the basic approach.\n\nChange-Id: Ibd3c0f089fefe38e6e6c607d65524990699c86d3\n"""

(DO NOT MERGE)\n\nIMPORTANT: This patch is a back-port from the internal master tree.\n           Do not merge it back.\n\nThis patch fixes the rebuild script to not use hard-coded Ubuntu\npackage URLs. This was problematic because some of these became\ninvalid when Ubuntu increased the version number of some of these\npackages and moved various ones to security.ubuntu.com.\n\nInstead we know download the Packages.bz2 corresponding to a given\nrelease and parse it to extract the versioned .deb URL to use from\nthe mirror.\n\nAlso add command-line options parsing. You don\u0027t need to define NDK\nin your environment anymore. Instead pass the path to the toolchain\nsources directory as in:\n\n   \u003cprogname\u003e /path/to/toolchain/src\n\nAlternatively use --ndk-dir\u003d\u003cpath\u003e to specify the path to your NDK\nand the script will automatically download and patch the toolchain\nsources from android.git.kernel.org for you as in:\n\n   \u003cprogname\u003e --ndk-dir\u003d/path/to/ndk\n\nBy default the script creates a tarball now (/tmp/\u003carchive-name\u003e)\nbut you can use --prefix\u003d\u003cpath\u003e to indicate an installation directory\nas in:\n\n   \u003cprogname\u003e --prefix\u003d/opt/workspace/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/ \u003cother-options\u003e\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The generated toolchain binaries still do not run\nproperly on Glibc 2.7 only the machine code they generate. We hope\nto solve this in the future with another patch.\n\nUse --help for complete usage information.\n\nOrig-Change-Id: Iadebd23f5e95600ca06415e9f2e4d05e694a305e\n

2938,"Visual adjustments to the layout feedback\n\nThis changeset makes a number of adjustments to the visual feedback\nshown during layout dragging \u0026 dropping selection etc.\n\nThese are:\n\n1. Render text on top of a translucent mask (white on a transparent\ngray rectangle). This ensures that the text is readable regardless of\nwhat content is under the text. We can\u0027t just use the background color\nfor the normal SWT drawString for two reasons: First we need to\ncontrol the alpha of the background only (since we want the text to be\nopaque and the background to be translucent) and second we often\nwant to draw multiple lines of text so we need to manually draw a\nbackground rectangle which accommodates the maximum width of ALL the\nlines such taht we don\u0027t have a ragged background.\n\n2. Paint the outline mode lines using solid translucent lines. And\nadjust the bounding box computation in this case by 1 pixel such that\nwhen you have adjacent boxes (such as in LinearLayout) you don\u0027t end\nup with two thin lines next to each other creating a thick line.\n\n3. Change the DrawingStyle internal API from \foreground\"" and\n\""background\"" colors to \""stroke\"" (border) and \""fill\"" (interior) with\nindividual alphas. This makes the color definitions simpler (for\nexample we don\u0027t need two separate styles one for the selection\nborder and one for the selection interior).\n\n4. Make the hover more subtle using no border and just a light\ntranslucent gray rectangle to only slightly draw attention to the view\nunder the mouse.\n\n5. Change the appearance of selection to light blue and use a long\ndashed border around it. The anchor lines are more faint and more\ntranslucent to make them stand out less.\n\n6. Change the appearance of the drop-preview to use a dash patterned\nborder identical to the selection border but colored orange instead.\nThe matching border pattern will hopefully reinforce that the\ndrop-preview line is where the selection (also dashed) will go.\n\n7. Use green to show available drop zones (the grid surrounding a\ntarget in RelativeLayout and the positions between elements in\nLinearLayout).\n\n8. For invalid drops use a white X on a red background as the overlay\nfill.\n\n9. I replaced the oval+X pattern from the LayoutHelpers and replaced\nthem with the orange dashed insert-position lines. I also adjusted the\nLinearLayout to draw the bounding boxes such that the middle of the\nbounding box rather than the top left edge are aligned with the\ninsert position.\n\nChange-Id: I85c77b9fa84b732a78aac635442f96e7ccfc3983\n"""

3034,Add transient visibility mode for empty containers\n\nWhen you add a new container such as a LinearLayout it is usually\ninvisible. The reason for this is that an empty layout has 0 width and\n0 height. There are two existing features in the layout editor to deal\nwith this: (1) Outline mode which renders rectangles around all\nviews and (2) Padding mode which adds 10 pixels of padding to all\nviews. In combination these two modes will create a rectangle for\nempty layouts making them visible and user-manipulatable -- you can\nfor example select or drop into them.\n\nThis changeset attempts to make dealing with these types of containers\neasier and more discoverable. It adds a new temporary mode where empty\ncontainers (and only empty containers) are automatically padded and\nhave their outlines painted. And more importantly this is only done\nin some limited scenarios: When you drag into or drag within the\nlayout canvas. As soon as you finish the drag empty containers\ndisappear again.\n\nUnlike padding mode we don\u0027t enlarge the design surface itself since\nthis mode comes and goes easily and frequently.\n\nIn addition to this there is special handling for selection. If you\nselect a zero-sized element (which for example is automatically done\nwhen you drop a new layout and which can also be done by clicking in\nthe outline) then the element is also revealed similar to the\nshow-empty mode but in this case only the selected item and not any\nother invisible containers are shown.\n\nChange-Id: Ibf3ec6a080a50a8f0f55919c3d3e6c4d2890468d\n

3108,yaffs: Better handling for partially written pages and blocks.\n\nPartially written pages (where a power interruption terminated the write)\nare problematic if we try to write into them because the programming can\nbe corrupted or worse still may *look* OK but fail to stick.\n\nIf we are uncertain as to the state of the block this patch checks the\nfirst page write carefully. This checks that the that the page is erased\nbefore trying to write to it and then does a verification afterwards. If\neither of these fail then we stop allocating off this block and let the\ngarbage collector clean up the block and recycle it for reuse.\n\nPartially written blocks are also potentially a problem because they might\nalso have been left in a strange state. yaffs resumes page allocation from\nwhere the last allocation left off but this patch rather skips allocation\nfrom the rest of this block. This has the impact of causing slightly more\ngarbage collection but that should be insignificant.\n\nTogether these two modifications should help to improve low-level robustness.\n\nChange-Id: Ib234be2172f191c0ad45c7da76a208f730453652\nSigned-off-by: Charles Manning \u003ccdhmanning@gmail.com\u003e\n

If vendors could change the parent of e.g. ‘CalendarTheme’\nfrom Android’s vanilla ‘Theme’ to ‘VendorTheme’ then vendor\nspecific adjustments could be done without changing any code directly.\n\nFrom looking at the code it can be seen that the parent value of a\nstyle is stored temporarily in ResourceTable::Entry::mParent while\noverlays are gone through in buildResources() and processed (in\nResourceTable::Entry::assignResourceIds()) at first after all overlays\nhave been handled so there aren’t any obvious reasons why changing\nparent in an overlay should be forbidden.\n\nChange-Id: I5969bb8aab90df437e1967fc504cc0da79107d13\n

3209,"Add Resize Support to the Layout Editor\n\nThis changeset adds \resizing\"" support to the layout editor.\n\nFirst the normal selection overlay is replaced with a selection\nrectangle which also has \""selection handles\"" in the corners and in the\nmiddle of each edge. Moving the cursor over one of the selection\nhandle will show a directional resize cursor and dragging the handle\nwill initiate a new resizing gesture. (This also made it possible to\nremove the selection fill we\u0027ve used until now so the layout editor\nwill \""interfere\"" less with the visual look of the layout.)\n\nDuring the resizing operation the current size is displayed in the\nEclipse status bar.\n\nThe resizability of widgets is determined by metadata so for example\na ZoomControls widget is not resizable a rating bar is only\nhorizontally resizable a TableRow is only vertically resizable and\nmost widgets are resizable in any direction.\n\nThe parent layout is involved in the resizing operation. Currently\nthe resizing gestures will only update the width and height properties\n(except for absolute layout which will also set the x and y\nproperties if you are dragging a left or top edge). In a follow up\nchangeset this will be extended to for example make RelativeLayout\nallow resize dragging to snap to new edges and the resize will be\napplied as a set of new constraints on the \""resized\"" widget. Thus\nyou\u0027ll be able to drag the right hand side of a widget and drag it\nover to attach to some other widget or edge independent of what the\nleft edge or vertical edges are bound to.\n\nThis changeset also adds the ability for ViewRules to provide a\nmessage or error message back to the IDE during a drag or resize\noperation. For resizing this is used to display the new size. However\nit is now also used to display more useful messages in a couple of\nolder scenarios:\n* Attempting to drag anything into a ListView will display a message\n  that AdapterViews much be configured via Java code\n* Attempting to drag anything into or within an AbsoluteLayout will\n  warn that AbsoluteLayouts are deprecated.\n\nNote that resizing will currently set the size to specific pixel (dip)\nsizes. In the next changeset I will add guidelines which (in addition\nto those described for RelativeLayout above) will add guidelines for\nsignificant sizes such as the parent size the preferred\n(wrap_content) size of the widget and possibly other hardcoded sizes\nin the same layout.\n\nChange-Id: Ie4f3367e81b24259a106c649c944008f4a3d31ec\n"""

3216,to optimize searching finalize method during classloading.\n\nWhen dalvikvm loads a class it calls the loadClassFromDex0\nfunction in Class.c. The loadMethodFromDex function then calls\nthe loadMethodFromDex function in a loop to load every direct\nmethod of this class. The loadMethodFromDex function will use\ndvmCompareNameDescriptorAndMethod which is implemented by using\nstrcmp to compare method name to check if the current method is\nthe finalize method defined by java and set the\nCLASS_ISFINALIZABLE flag if true. The problem is that after\ndalvikvm has found the finalize method in a class it still calls\nstrcmp to check the following methods which is unnecessary. This\npatch simply optimized it by checking the CLASS_ISFINALIZABLE flag\nbefore calling strcmp so that the classloading is slightly faster.\n\nChange-Id: Ie1ea33ce3f46c9a45605b7be6ec73622e1b0d301\nSigned-off-by: xiaoxi.meng \u003cxiaoxi.meng@gmail.com\u003e\n

This works around the\nissue that the SDK Manager tries by default to only show\nunknown platforms that are higher than whatever is currently\ninstalled so there was no way with the UI to install an\nolder platform (e.g. if you had API 11 installed it would\nnot list APIS 3-10 for new installation.)\nI\u0027ll revisit this behavior later.\n\nSDK Issue: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id\u003d15933\n\nChange-Id: I7626257c39602908058eb7359b4c98cc3f54eef3\n"""

Since sequence number is optional\nreceiving a packet without it will drop all queued packets.\n\nCurrently the logic is triggered by incoming packets so queued\npackets have to wait till another packet is arrived. It is done for\nsimplicity since no additional locks or threads are required. For\nreliable protocols a retransmission will kick it. For unreliable\nprotocols queued packets just seem like packet loss. Time-critical\nprotocols might be broken but they never work with queueing anyway.\n\nSigned-off-by: Chia-chi Yeh \u003cchiachi@android.com\u003e\n

3471,[ARM] tegra: add LP2 idle-mode support\n\nLP2 idle mode power-gates the main CPU complex requiring a\nfull processor state save and restore from a reset vector\n\nprocessor context area is allocated during platform initialization\nfrom the kernel and mapped into the hotplug page tables (which also\nserve as the initial page tables for the LP2 main processor reset)\n\nrestoring the processor from LP2 requires calculation of a system-\nand APB-clock-dependent CPU power good timer value. on Harmony\n2ms is a good baseline value for this and the APB clock is running at\n13.5MHz. these values need to be un-hardcoded for other platforms.\n\nSigned-off-by: Gary King \u003cgking@nvidia.com\u003e\n

3473,[ARM] tegra: add CPU_IDLE driver\n\nsupports clock-gated (LP3) SMP idle mode and power-gated (LP2) idle\nmode when all slave processors are off-line\n\nlatency for LP2 idle state is calculated as a 2-sample weighted moving\naverage to allow for future variations due to (e.g.) CPU frequency\nscaling.\n\nwhen LP2 is an allowed state (i.e. slave CPUs have been taken off-line)\nLP3 will perform an hrtimer peek-ahead; this avoids waiting for the\nfirst processor tick following an LP2 in order to run expired hrtimers\n(which was causing a 1 tick delay for most user-space sleeps)\n\nLP2 wakeup time and latency uses a 2ms hard-coded offset to account for\nthe CPU powergood timeout; this is reasonable for Harmony but should be\nun-hardcoded for other platforms.\n\nSigned-off-by: Gary King \u003cgking@nvidia.com\u003e\n

3477,Add drop shadow to dragged items\n\nAdd in a drop shadow to items dragged from the palette. The primary\nreason we need this is that some views (in some themes) only render\nlight content on top of a transparent background which makes them\nnearly impossible to see on a gray background (e.g. over the palette\nwhen you initiate the drag). The drop shadow helps add contrast. It\nalso makes the drag look better since it helps the drag preview image\nstand out from the background and visually appear to be lifted on top\nof it.\n\nSince we\u0027re doing more image processing now I moved the existing\nnon-SWT image manipulation methods into a separate ImageUtils class.\n\nThis changeset also fixes the way we pick the color to crop out when\nusing older layout libraries (without transparency support). We now\npick a pixel closer to the bounds of the rendered view such that we\nfor example can handle themes like the dialog theme.\n\nChange-Id: Ifcbb840ef715bf26a9609f6996a4f136de5ca754\n

3492,Improvements to LinearLayout feedback\n\nWhen you have a small and empty linear layout and you drag something\nlarger (such as a button) into it the drop feedback is a bit\nconfusing: The drop feedback rectangle is larger than the linear\nlayout so the bounds are outside the layout. This changeset addresses\nthis by forcing the bounds of the drop preview to be at most the\ndimensions of the LinearLayout itself.\n\nSecond the fix I applied last week to show the last insert position\ndid not work in all cases - in particular when the drag originates\noutside the canvas itself. To determine if we are inserting at the\nlast position look at the number of target node children rather than\nthe number of potential insert positions since in some cases the\nnumber of insert positions will be smaller than the number of\nchildren.\n\nFinally there was a theoretical bug that if one of the dragged\nelements did not non-zero bounds then the insert position would be\nwrong. This is also fixed by this changeset.\n\nChange-Id: Ia30e99f7a3aa45b8091855b69aaef86ec3699405\n

3503,Preview items on palette drags\n\nThis checkin renders previews of Android views as you drag them from\nthe palette using the current theme settings you have for the\nassociated editor. If you are using version 5 or later of the layout\nlibrary you get full alpha-blending on the rendered views (so for\nexample in an analog clock you see right through it) and on older\nversion it simply crops out the edge color.\n\nThe preview image is semi-translucent and the image is centered under\nthe mouse pointer. The drag feedback operations all relate to the top\nleft corner of the dragged item so they are passed in the mouse\ncursor minus the delta to the top left corner of the image.\n\nThe size of the preview is also used to provide bounds for the drag\nfeedback such that we can show a preview rectangle rather than just\nthe insert point over layouts that support drop feedback.\n\nSome views can\u0027t be rendered (e.g. QuickContactBadge) and some views\ndon\u0027t have any pixels painted (e.g. all the empty layouts) and in\nthat case we fall back to showing the palette item itself (the icon\nand label) as you\u0027re dragging.\n\nThere\u0027s also a new utility class for SWT common utilities like image\nconversion.\n\nChange-Id: I315c2dd733317bbada8dae89f57280ced2d7bb51\n

3505,preemptoff tracer: trace the preempt disable/enable at preempt_schedule\n\npreempt_schedule() uses the _notrace versions of the preemption\ndisable/enable routines for setting the PREEMPT_ACTIVE flag to avoid\na race condition per commit d1f74e2.  This causes the preemptoff\ntrace to not be properly terminated when the preempted thread is\nrescheduled.  Since the original fix only converted the preempt\nre-enable to use the _notrace version for symmetry call the tracing\nversion instead.  The corresponding preemptoff start will be\ntraced by the preempt_disable() in schedule() although this may\nbe relying on a fragile state of affairs and it may be best to also\nadd a direct call to trace a preempt disable after preemption is\nsafely disabled and the race avoided.\n\nChange-Id: If591cba277bbb32d00fdbe0e3c3e5963c48d69fc\nSigned-off-by: Todd Poynor \u003ctoddpoynor@google.com\u003e\n

3507,Integrate 80bc5c8c into tools_r8. DO NOT MERGE.\n\nFix incorrect orientation at boot.\n\nThe goldfish kernel\u0027s event driver is very picky about the\nstate of the virtual device it talks to. Essentially it can\nonly listen to h/w events if the corresponding IRQ is raised\n_after_ it has completed some initial setup.\n\nIf the IRQ is raised before the driver will refuse to listen\nto events and any interaction becomes impossible.\n\nWe changed the way our UI windows are built and managed\npreviously and this had the unfortunate effect of sending\none h/w event too soon which in the old code would raise\nthe IRQ prematurely. This resulted in an input freeze.\n\nTo work around this the UI code was modified to not send\nthe initial h/w event but this resulted in bad orientation\nof the home screen at the end of the boot sequence.\n\nThis change allows the virtual device to wait for the kernel\ndriver before raising the IRQ in the case any h/w event has\nbeen buffered. It also removes the hack in the UI code\nallowing the send of the initial h/w event at startup.\n\nBONUS MINOR CHANGES:\n    EsounD probe: fix error message.\n    console: fix compiler warnings\n    libpng: proper handling of MMX support.\n    android-configure.sh: fix --ignore-audio handling\n        The option didn\u0027t do anything if the audio development packages\n        are properly installed on the system.\n\nChange-Id: I675d181abb662222bb03f264aa87238fd8edb8cc\n

This makes the poll() abortable\nby writing a byte to the local pipe in asocket_abort().\n\nasocket_create() sets the fd to non-blocking mode. It must not be changed to\nblocking mode.\n\nUsing asocket will triple the number of file descriptors required per\nsocket due to the local pipe.

As the syncpoint state is\nsaved and restored automatically by the host driver a cpu increment of\na syncpoint in the powered down state will be lost.\n\nAlso adds checks for host module being powered.\n**\nvideo: tegra: fb: add ioctl to flip dc windows to nvmap handles\n\ntegra user-space graphics drivers may allocate framebuffers using\nnvmap rather than rendering to the common framebuffer this may\nbe done to support deeper buffer pipelining color formats\nand pixel layouts other than the initial bootup framebuffer\netc.\n\nto use this ioctl a caller must first specify an nvmap fd\nwhich is already open in the calling process so that the\nsubsequent flip ioctls may be properly validated. flips are performed\nasynchronously with flip completion notifications provided back to\nthe caller via the host1x syncpoint mechanism\n\nbased on earlier changes made by Antti Hatala \u003cahatala@nvidia.com\u003e\nand Erik Gilling \u003ckonkers@android.com\u003e\n\nChange-Id: I4e8a8bb92085a485d65fd87d89112b2969ee37ff\nSigned-off-by: Gary King \u003cgking@nvidia.com\u003e\n

3708,"Add per-view custom initialization logic\n\nThis changeset adds support for adding custom-logic to initialize\nviews both to add children and default attributes and to customize\nlayout attributes when added to a new parent.\n\nFirst there is a new \onCreate\"" hook which is called to notify a view\nrule that an instance of its corresponding view has been created. This\nlets the ViewRule perform custom initialization of the object. The\nViewRule is told what type of insertion occurred such that it can\ndistinguish between a newly created view a view that is the result of\na copy/paste and a view that is part of a move operation.\n\nThe changeset adds a number of new ViewRules which take advantage of\nthis:\n- A TabHost rule creates the various skeleton children that are\n  required such as a TabWidget child with id @android:id/tabs and a\n  FrameLayout child with id @android:id/tabcontent\n- A DialerFilter rule creates the mandatory EditText children (\""hint\""\n  and \""primary\"")\n- The HorizontalScrollView rule creates a horizontal LinearLayout child\n- The ImageButton and ImageViewButtons initialize the \""src\"" attribute\n  to a sample image\n- The MapViewRule initializes the apiKey attribute\n\nIn addition views are also notified when a new view is added as a\nchild such that they can perform additional customizations in the\nform of an \""onInsert\"" event.\n\nThe most important application of this is LinearLayoutRule which uses\nthis to set reasonable defaults for the layout_width and layout_height\nparameters. It uses metadata (which is currently built into ADT but\nwould ideally migrate into our XML config files) to determine whether\na given child prefers to grow horizontally grow vertically both or\nneither depending on the surrounding parent context.  For example an\nEditText will default to filling the parent width if it is in a\nvertical LinearLayout but it will not grow vertically in a horizontal\nlinear layout. And so on. Various other rules also use the onInsert\nevent to tweak children attributes. A ScrollView will for example\nalways initialize its single child to match parent.\n\nViews can now also add plain menu items into the context menu and the\nTableViewRule adds one such action: \""Add Row\"" which appends a new row\ninto the table.\n\nThe Palette Preview code also invokes these creation hooks such that\nif you for example drag a DialerFilter it can properly render since\nthe mandatory children are created up front. This required various\nchanges to the preview code to be able to handle XML edits by the\nrules.\n\nFinally this changeset includes various other misc changes that I\nperformed at the same time:\n- Removed SWT dependency from the ViewRule classes (SWT Rectangle use\n  in Rect)\n- Fixed AbsoluteLayout unit test (issue 3203560)\n- Fixed positioning of the preview outline in LinearLayout when only\n   one of the dimensions are clipped due to a smaller target layout\n\nChange-Id: I5956fe4e7a31a20b8dd2f9d9b0c1f90e2f75d68a\n"""

3877,ADT GLE2: Access AttributeInfo from groovy scripts.\n\nThis CL extracts IAttributeInfo from DeclareStyleable -- this used\nto be the metadata extracted from an attribute declared in attrs.xml.\n\nThe interface that is now available to groovy scripts lets them\ncheck whether an attribute is a reference a string etc. For an\nenum or flag that means having access to the defined values too.\n\nIn the case of the AbsoluteLayout drop we use this info to check if\nan attribute is a reference. For example when duplicating a\nRelativeLayout dropped in an AbsoluteLayout we need to create new\nids and the RelativeLayout is prone to have inner self-references\nthat can be automatically adjusted that way.\n\nA large part of the CL is about refactoring the various manually-created\nattributes in the Descriptors for resources XML and such. In this\ncase the IAttributeInfo that is made available via the AttributeDescriptor\nis not used but it made sense to keep this consistent in case we want\nto expose it later and to avoid having to care about special cases.\n\nChange-Id: Ic02f69bc16f0e549fcac3956ae93b86651c5be3c\n

3969,RelativeLayout: Assign ids dynamically handle multi-drag bugs\n\nThis CL fixes three issues with the new relative layout interaction:\n\n(1) Assign ids dynamically. Before this changeset you couldn\u0027t attach\n    to a node which does not have an @id attribute since layout\n    params need to name the constraint by id.\n\n    This changeset changes this such that you can attach to any\n    arbitrary edge and when you commit the drag a unique id is\n    generated on the fly and assigned to the node.\n\n(2) Handle dragging multiple nodes at the same time. The new\n    constraints code was unconditionally applying the same constraints\n    to all the dragged nodes which meant they ended up on top of each\n    other. This fixes things such that the first node is assigned the\n    new constraints and then all subsequent nodes are attached one\n    next to the other in a direction depending on which edge you\n    attached to (e.g. attaching on the right will arrange the siblings\n    towards the left out from the edge.)\n\n(3) Fix a bug in the code to detect and prevent cycles.\n\nChange-Id: I157d45e117d3229f285870517b85ed902607b966\n

4012,"Auto hide virtual keyboard\n\nSometimes the virtual keyboard was not hidden when switching between\napplications. An example of this was when launching the browser from\nthe Google Search widget:\n1) Tap the Google Search widget and enter some text e.g. \google\""\n2) Select one search items e.g. \""google maps\""\n3) Browser opens. Press back button.\n4) Select an item again e.g. \""google maps\"" - Keyboard does not\n   close.\n\nWhen switching application the virtual keyboard needs to find a new\nZ position (window index) among the other windows. Normally it is\nplaced on top of the first window that is visible and can get focus\n(canBeImeTarget()).\n\nWith a new application being launched there is\nan exception: a special \""starting window\"" is placed on top of the\nActivity window while the application is starting up. Since this\nwindow should not get input we need to look below that window.\nWhen doing this the previous implementation assumed that the\nfirst window below always was focusable. If it wasn\u0027t the\ninput method was placed above the \""starting window\"" which\ncaused confusion that led to the keyboard not being closed\nautomatically.\n\nIn the case of the Browser it sometimes has a \""fake TitleBar\""\nwindow that can not get focus and that is placed above the\nActivity window.\n\nWith this fix we now keep looking through the windows below\nthe \""starting window\"" until we find a window that can receive\ninput.\n\nChange-Id: I1117846eb0f57603e64329bd955e28182f98f226\n"""

4089,Downloading of a file has a small chance of failing randomly.\n\nDue to timing issues a download could be cancelled. This happens when the\ndownloading state machine gets in the wrong state. There are two variables\nin the state machine which gets out of sync with each other: status and\nmHasActiveThread.\nThe DownloadService thread reads several downloads from the database\nand starts to process them. For each applicable download a DowloadThread\nis started. For that download mHasActiveThread is set to true and the\ndownload is started. When the download is finished the correct status\nis written to the database and mHasActiveThread is set to false.\nThe problem is that mHasActiveThread changes value instantly in\nDownloadService but the status for all downloads are read from the\ndatabase at certain times. If the DownloadThread changes the value of\nmHasActiveThread before that download has been processed in the\nDownloadService thread the value of mHasActiveThread will be up to date\nbut the status value will be out of sync.\nThe download will then be restarted even if it is already completed. The\nDownloadService will interpred the download as a resume but the server will\nhandle it as a new download. The downloading statemachine will then be\nconfused and terminate the download.\nThis is fixed by synching the changing of status and mHasActiveThread between\nDownloadService and DownloadThread. The database information in DowloadService\nwill also be re-read when it is not up to date.\n\nChange-Id: I8bb28b42b434b424187c918dfded4fdf3baa055b\n

4253,"Usability fix for the layout actions bar\n\nThe layout actions bar shows actions of two types:\n\n* Actions which edit attriubutes of the \current layout\""; typically\n  the parent of the currently selected views.  For example the\n  \""orientation\"" or \""baseline\"" attributes of a LinearLayout.\n\n* Actions which edit the layout parameters of the selected views. For\n  example the \""weight\"" attribute of children in a LinearLayout.\n\nOne thing which was missing is adding in layout actions for views that\nare children. For example the TableView now has an \""Insert Row\""\naction.  If you select the table itself rather than a child within\nthe table you would not see the Insert Row action. Similarly if you\ndrop a new LinearLayout you cannot toggle its orientation attribute;\nit won\u0027t be shown or if it is within another LinearLayout you will\nsee an orientation toggle but it controls the parent not the newly\nselected LinearLayout.\n\nThis changeset addresses this by adding a new section of actions on\nthe right hand side of the actions bar which contains the layout\nactions which apply to the selection regardless of the parent type.\n\nFor example if you have a LinearLayout containing a TableLayout and\nyou have selected the TableLayout you will first see the LinearLayout\nactions then the LinearLayout layoutparams actions (which will be\napplied to the TableLayout) and finally the TableLayout layout\nactions (insert and remove row).\n\nThis changeset also improves the TableLayout insert row action to\ninsert the row before the current selected row (if any) rather than\nunconditionally appending it to the end. It also selects the table\nafter creation to make it more obvious where it was added.  The new\nability to select nodes from layout rules is also used in a couple of\nother places.\n\nChange-Id: I7cd8f75e61fc916bc75ed5ad156440f0f8cbd786\n"""

4349,This is the first set of build system changes to support\narchitecture versions other than ARMv5TE.\n\nThe general approach is to provide TARGET_ARCH_VERSION to complement\nTARGET_ARCH. This defaults to the current armv5te. The variable\nvalues should match the architectures as defined by gcc. (They\nare passed directly to -march).\n\nThere is a block of defines for each supported architecture version\n(currently ARMv5TE and ARMv4). Each block defines a set of features\nusing HAVE_\u003cx\u003e variables. It also specifies a set of c preprocessor\ndefines to pass to the compiler. Finally it defines a default CPU.\n(As for architecture versions the default CPU should match a CPU\nthat gcc knows about.)\n\nA TARGET_CPU variable is provided. The architecture version can\nset a default value for this or the user can specify it (either\nthrough a BoardConfig.mk or command line).\n\n-march and -mtune c-flags are now set using information outlined\nabove.\n\nSupport is added for architectures that do not support THUMB. Specifically\nwe change the \u0027thumb compile\u0027 target to simply compile as ARM code\ninstead and we change the interworking flag passed to the compiler.\n\nFinally we ensure that the system/core/include/arch/linux-arm directory\nis added to the default include path which allows the use of asm/macros.h\nheader file described in review #1612. The way in which this done is\nconsiderably unclean/hacky if someone can suggest a better way please\nlet me know.\n

To use the macros assembly\ncode should #include \u003casm/macros.h\u003e.\n\nFurther commits to the build system will add -Iinclude/arch/linux-arm\nto the C flags so that the include is correctly picked up.\n

4376,Fix drag and drop handler to handle reentry\n\nIf you drag from the palette over a linear layout view you get drop\nfeedback. However if you drag outside the linear layout and then back\nin you often don\u0027t get any more feedback. This happens pretty easily\nwith nested layouts.\n\nThe problem is that the feedback object is initialized and reset in\nonDropEnter but the actual guideline computation happens in\nonDropMove (since only drop move is handed the mouse coordinates). The\nbug happens because when you leave and return to the drop zone the\nfeedback object is reset and then the drop feedback is painted - all\nbefore the onDropMove code has been called again.\n\nThe fix is simple: On drop enter also call onDropMove immediately\nsuch that the layout helpers are given a chance to initialize\nthemselves with the entry mouse position before they are consulted\nfor drop feedback data.\n\nThis changeset also contains a fix for LinearLayouts: When there are\nno children place the guideline at x\u003d0 or y\u003d0 (depending on whether\nthe layout is horizontal or vertical). Without this fix the line is\nplaced in the center of the view which is misleading since that is\nnot where the view will be placed upon drop.\n\nChange-Id: Ib5e17a2d9d3818677e4209126233bbde527207c8\n

4423,This is the first set of build system changes to support\narchitecture versions other than ARMv5TE.\n\nThe general approach is to provide TARGET_ARCH_VERSION to complement\nTARGET_ARCH. This defaults to the current armv5te. The variable\nvalues should match the architectures as defined by gcc.\n\nThere is a block of defines for each supported architecture version\n(currently ARMv5TE and ARMv4). Each block defines a set of features\nusing ARCH_ARM_HAVE_\u003cx\u003e variables. It also specifies a set of c\npreprocessor defines to pass to the compiler. Finally it defines a\ndefault CPU. (As for architecture versions the default CPU should\nmatch a CPU that gcc knows about.)\n\nSupport is added for architectures that do not support THUMB. Specifically\nwe change the \u0027thumb compile\u0027 target to simply compile as ARM code\ninstead and we change the interworking flag passed to the compiler.\n\nFinally we ensure that the system/core/include/arch/linux-arm directory\nis added to the default include path which allows the use of asm/macros.h\nheader file described in review #1612. The way in which this done is\nconsiderably unclean/hacky if someone can suggest a better way please\nlet me know.\n

4439,This is the first in a series of changesets to enable compiling for\nARM architectures other than ARMv5TE.\n\nThis changes AndroidConfig.h to add specific ARCH_ARM_HAVE_\u003cx\u003e defines for\ndifferent functionality/instructions available in the different ARM\narchitecture version.\n\nasm/macros.h uses these defines to create conditionalised macros\nthat assembly programmers can use to make code more portable.\n\nFurther changes will update specific ASM files to take advantage of\nthese defines and conditional macros. To use the macros assembly\ncode should #include \u003casm/macros.h\u003e.\n\nFurther commits to the build system will add -Iinclude/arch/linux-arm\nto the C flags so that the include is correctly picked up.\n
4440,This is the first set of build system changes to support\narchitecture versions other than ARMv5TE.\n\nThe general approach is to provide TARGET_ARCH_VERSION to complement\nTARGET_ARCH. This defaults to the current armv5te. The variable\nvalues should match the architectures as defined by gcc.\n\nThere is a block of defines for each supported architecture version\n(currently ARMv5TE and ARMv4). Each block defines a set of features\nusing ARCH_ARM_HAVE_\u003cx\u003e variables. It also specifies a set of c\npreprocessor defines to pass to the compiler. Finally it defines a\ndefault CPU. (As for architecture versions the default CPU should\nmatch a CPU that gcc knows about.)\n\nSupport is added for architectures that do not support THUMB. Specifically\nwe change the \u0027thumb compile\u0027 target to simply compile as ARM code\ninstead and we change the interworking flag passed to the compiler.\n\nFinally we ensure that the system/core/include/arch/linux-arm directory\nis added to the default include path which allows the use of asm/macros.h\nheader file described in review #1626. The way in which this done is\nconsiderably unclean/hacky if someone can suggest a better way please\nlet me know.\n

Many existing Camera applications\n  and CTS tests expects that Camera hardware has it\u0027s default framerate setting.\n  Thus CameraHardware should provide default values for both framerate\n  methods at the same time.

4547,Merge 0b95acc1 from master to r12. do not merge.\n\nRelativeLayout: Assign ids dynamically handle multi-drag bugs\n\nThis CL fixes three issues with the new relative layout interaction:\n\n(1) Assign ids dynamically. Before this changeset you couldn\u0027t attach\n    to a node which does not have an @id attribute since layout\n    params need to name the constraint by id.\n\n    This changeset changes this such that you can attach to any\n    arbitrary edge and when you commit the drag a unique id is\n    generated on the fly and assigned to the node.\n\n(2) Handle dragging multiple nodes at the same time. The new\n    constraints code was unconditionally applying the same constraints\n    to all the dragged nodes which meant they ended up on top of each\n    other. This fixes things such that the first node is assigned the\n    new constraints and then all subsequent nodes are attached one\n    next to the other in a direction depending on which edge you\n    attached to (e.g. attaching on the right will arrange the siblings\n    towards the left out from the edge.)\n\n(3) Fix a bug in the code to detect and prevent cycles.\n\nChange-Id: I3da16903ffac6c34a0d5efee52a87824fb9e04fb\n

4955,Setting time zone might cause processes to have different time zones\n\nIf you set the default time zone during heavy load of the system\njava processes listening to ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED might not\nget the new time zone value.\n\n1. The time zone is stored in a static variable. That value is based\non a system property. Setting a new time zone triggers all\nprocessess to reset the static variable by fetching from the system\nproperty but sometimes the system property has not been populated\nyet causing processes to reset the static variable with the old\nvalue.\n\nSolution: add param with the new time zone when updating\nall processes.\n\n2. Updating the process default time zone is posted to a Binder\nThread while the broadcast of ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED is posted\nto main. If the Binder Thread is busy the broadcast might\nget handled on the main thread before the time zone is updated.\n\nSolution: Make sure that the time zone is updated before calling\nonReceive\n\nChange-Id: I0cb99e986b326aa5052a37b1b3e4a53102473008\n

5186,"epoll keyed wakeups: add __wake_up_locked_key() and __wake_up_sync_key()\n\nThis patchset introduces wakeup hints for some of the most popular (from\nepoll POV) devices so that epoll code can avoid spurious wakeups on its\nwaiters.\n\nThe problem with epoll is that the callback-based wakeups do not ATM\ncarry any information about the events the wakeup is related to.  So the\nonly choice epoll has (not being able to call f_op-\u003epoll() from inside the\ncallback) is to add the file* to a ready-list and resolve the real events\nlater on at epoll_wait() (or its own f_op-\u003epoll()) time.  This can cause\nspurious wakeups since the wake_up() itself might be for an event the\ncaller is not interested into.\n\nThe rate of these spurious wakeup can be pretty high in case of many\nnetwork sockets being monitored.\n\nBy allowing devices to report the events the wakeups refer to (at least\nthe two major classes - POLLIN/POLLOUT) we are able to spare useless\nwakeups by proper handling inside the epoll\u0027s poll callback.\n\nEpoll will have in any case to call f_op-\u003epoll() on the file* later on\nsince the change to be done in order to have the full event set sent via\nwakeup is too invasive for the way our f_op-\u003epoll() system works (the\nfull event set is calculated inside the poll function - there are too many\nof them to even start thinking the change - also poll/select would need\nchange too).\n\nEpoll is changed in a way that both devices which send event hints and\nthe ones that don\u0027t are correctly handled.  The former will gain some\nefficiency though.\n\nAs a general rule for devices would be to add an event mask by using\nkey-aware wakeup macros when making up poll wait queues.  I tested it\n(together with the epoll\u0027s poll fix patch Andrew has in -mm) and wakeups\nfor the supported devices are correctly filtered.\n\nTest program available here:\n\nhttp://www.xmailserver.org/epoll_test.c\n\nThis patch:\n\nNothing revolutionary here.  Just using the available \key\"" that our\nwakeup core already support.  The __wake_up_locked_key() was no brainer\nsince both __wake_up_locked() and __wake_up_locked_key() are thin wrappers\naround __wake_up_common().\n\nThe __wake_up_sync() function had a body so the choice was between\nborrowing the body for __wake_up_sync_key() and calling it from\n__wake_up_sync() or make an inline and calling it from both.  I chose the\nformer since in most archs it all resolves to \""mov $0 REG; jmp ADDR\"".\n\nSigned-off-by: Davide Libenzi \u003cdavidel@xmailserver.org\u003e\nCc: Alan Cox \u003calan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk\u003e\nCc: Ingo Molnar \u003cmingo@elte.hu\u003e\nCc: David Miller \u003cdavem@davemloft.net\u003e\nCc: William Lee Irwin III \u003cwli@movementarian.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton \u003cakpm@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds \u003ctorvalds@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: San Mehat \u003csan@google.com\u003e\n"""

This means\nwe can easily build this using the makefile which *only*\nlinks with the 32-bit/carbon version of SWT.jar.\n\nNote that on Windows/Linux the src-darwin folder will\nbe ignored which is why it is not mapped as a source\ndirectory and which is why we can\u0027t build this directly\nfrom Eclipse.\n\nChange-Id: I53859d3b15bc7026d6bd4f77e048a0c4b4eeb02c\n

5219,sched timers: move calc_load() to scheduler\n\nDimitri Sivanich noticed that xtime_lock is held write locked across\ncalc_load() which iterates over all online CPUs. That can cause long\nlatencies for xtime_lock readers on large SMP systems.\n\nThe load average calculation is an rough estimate anyway so there is\nno real need to protect the readers vs. the update. It\u0027s not a problem\nwhen the avenrun array is updated while a reader copies the values.\n\nInstead of iterating over all online CPUs let the scheduler_tick code\nupdate the number of active tasks shortly before the avenrun update\nhappens. The avenrun update itself is handled by the CPU which calls\ndo_timer().\n\n[ Impact: reduce xtime_lock write locked section ]\n\nSigned-off-by: Thomas Gleixner \u003ctglx@linutronix.de\u003e\nAcked-by: Peter Zijlstra \u003cpeterz@infradead.org\u003e\n\nConflicts:\n\n\tkernel/sched.c\n\tkernel/sched_idletask.c\n\nSigned-off-by: San Mehat \u003csan@google.com\u003e\n

5259,media: video: add V4L2_CID_BG_COLOR and V4L2_CID_ROTATION\n\nAdded V4L2_CID_BG_COLOR for background color setting. Added V4L2_CID_ROTATION for rotation setting. Above two ioclts are indepth discussed. Posting again with the driver usage.\n\nV4L2 supports chroma keying added new flags for the\nsource chroma keying which is exactly opposite of the\nchorma keying supported by V4L2.\n\nIn current implementation framebuffer pixels with\nthe chromakey color are replaced by video pixels.\n\nWhile for the source chroma keying video pixels with\nthe chromakey color are replaced by the framebuffer\npixels.\n\nBoth are exactly opposite and so are mutually exclusive\n\nCommunity Comments fixed in this post\n1. Replaced V4L2_CID_ROTATION by V4L2_CID_ROTATE.\n2. Initilize min and max values for V4L2_CID_BG_COLOR\ncontrol id.\n3.

This commits fixes that crash\nand teaches the tokenizer to just continue to run anyway. Two\nsimple junit testcases has also been added for testing the\ndefault and the errornous case.\n

5409,"Fix shutdown sequence to avoid SIGSEGV when running am command\n\nWhen the app_process is shutting down the main thread will close the\nbinder fd while pool threads are executing an ioctl (in\nIPCThreadState::stopProcess called by AppRuntime::onStarted in\napp_main.c).\n\nThe binder driver will then return all pending calls in ioctl\nwithout any error and with a command. One of the threads gets a\nBR_SPAWN_LOOPER which will create a new thread (the other thread\ngets a BR_NOOP). This new thread then calls\nvm-\u003eAttachCurrentThread. Usually this results in a log entry with\n\AndroidRuntime: NOTE: attach of thread \u0027Binder Thread #3\u0027 failed\""\nbut sometimes it also causes a SIGSEGV. This depends on the timing\nbetween the new thread an the main thread that calls DestroyJavaVM\n(in AndroidRuntime::start).\n\nIf IPCThreadState.cpp is compiled with \""#define LOG_NDEBUG 0\"" the\npool thread will loop and hit the\nLOG_ASSERT(mProcess-\u003emDriverFD \u003e\u003d 0) in\nIPCThreadState::talkWithDriver.\n\nCrashes like this has been seen when running the am command and\nother commands that use the app_process.\n\nThis fix makes sure that any command that is received when the driver\nfd is closed are ignored and IPCThreadState::talkWithDriver instead\nreturns an error which will cause the pool thread to exit and detach\nitself from the vm. A check to avoid calling ioctl to a fd with -1\nwas also added in IPCThreadState::threadDestructor.\n\nAnother solution might be to change the binder driver so that it\nreturns an error when the fd is closed (or atleast not a\nBR_SPAWN_LOOPER command). It might also be possible to call exit(0)\nwhich is done when System.exit(0) is called from java.\n\nChange-Id: I3d1f0ff64896c44be2a5994b3a90f7a06d27f429\n"""

In addition to editing the XML type declaration\n    it also removes layout parameters that no longer apply and\n    depending on which layout you are converting from and converting\n    to it may attempt to perform some translation to preserve the\n    layout characteristics.  In particular if you convert from a\n    LinearLayout to a RelativeLayout then it will use RelativeLayout\n    params to emulate the old LinearLayout by attaching items below\n    (for vertical layouts) or to the right of (for horizontal layout)\n    the previous sibling and if the baseline property was set on the\n    LinearLayout it will also add baseline constraints on the\n    RelativeLayout. (It also adds default ids on any elements that\n    need it.)\n\n    There is a LOT more we can do to support layout transformations;\n    this is just a beginning.\n\n(3) Extract as Include. We already had this feature but it performed\n    its own XML document manipulation.  This code has been rewritten\n    to use the Eclipse refactoring support (which the other two\n    refactorings are implemented to use as well) which among other\n    things means that you get Preview support - you can press Preview\n    from the refactoring dialog to see the edits before they are\n    made. This rewrite is also necessary to support an upcoming\n    feature: the ability to replace occurrences in other\n    configuration-variations of this layout; for that we need to\n    ability to do multi-file changes which the refactoring support is\n    ideal for.\n\nChange-Id: I50b142645f14c29c798fc02df6df69bad5b9426c\n"""

Normally it would then attempt to mount partitions of the device but as \""busy\"" is specially treated in the code it does not consider this to be an error condition.\n\nThe argment for this check is that \""the device is likely already mounted\"" but that is obviously not something that should be assumed (and is not true in this example situation). Even if the device were already mounted from the auto-mounter\u0027s viewpoint this should be considered an error anyway as it failed to mount it as it was told. I therefore believe this check to not only be causing the above problem but also to be incorrect.

Loading driver firmware as a result of using insmod in the init.rc is a multi-threaded operation.\n

Here is what needed to be tweaked to make\nit work:\n\n1. I didn\u0027t see an open NDK Eclair project so I copied the\n   cpufeatures source code to a temporary directory under CTS.\n\n2. There was no public SDK Java method to get the second ABI\n   property. However I went ahead and used the hidden API\n   due to the importance of the test.\n\nThis test already exists in Froyo and uses the proper public API.\nThis test will not be merged into Froyo and future releases.\n\nChange-Id: I20fcc21096f468fb733fcf34842b218e41dabbc1\n

5637,Add Show Included In safeguard and work around Eclipse DOM bug\n\nFirst add a check in the view hierarchy code to ensure that when we\nare attempting to render a view included within another that the\nincluded view\u0027s model is actually included in the render. If it is\nnot then clear the inclusion context and re-render. This shouldn\u0027t be\nnecessary since we only offer Show Included In for views known to be\nincluding the current view but if something should go wrong somewhere\n(such as a stale include list or the current bug we have with parser\nnesting) this is a useful fallback to prevent major confusion.\n\nSecond add in null checks for a couple of places where we were\ncalling DOM Element.getAttributeNS.

5666,Prevent accidental dragging of the root layout\n\nThe layout editor deliberately does not reset the selection if you\nstart dragging within the bounding rectangle of one (of possibly\nmultiple) selected widgets. However since it\u0027s pretty easy to have\nthe root element selected this sometimes means you end up trying to\ndrag an item only to realize you can\u0027t because everything fits within\nthe root bounding rectangle.\n\nThis changeset fixes this usability issue by making the root widget a\nspecial case. If you are dragging *only* the root things work as\nbefore. But if you are trying to drag anything else it will ignore\nthe root which means that you can drag one or more items\nindependently of the root whether or not it is included in the\nselection.\n\nChange-Id: Ia7497659e57dcc6431c3760a53847268a8b90815\n

While the caller is blocked pending write() calls will\n   return immediately with whatever data they had managed to queue up.\n-- removed ioctl(TEGRA_AUDIO_OUT_PRELOAD_FIFO)\n-- since TEGRA_AUDIO_OUT_FLUSH and TEGRA_AUDIO_IN_STOP act similarly moved\n   audio_driver_state::recording_cancelled to audio_stream::stop and changed\n   the code accordingly.  Renamed functions wait_for_recording_to_stop() and\n   stop_recording_nosync() to wait_till_stopped() and request_stop_nosync()\n   since they handle both playback and recording.\n-- print errors on close() if wakelocks are still held\n-- Call request_stop_nosync() on close() of a recording file handle\n-- Do not use struct audio_stream::active for playback streams.  Instead\n   where applicable use kfifo_len().  As a consequence playback kfifo\n   underruns are no longer reported.  These were bogus anyway as we really\n   need the DMA engine to tell us if there are underruns.\n-- Because of above item had to rework tx_fifo_atn_store()\n   rx_fifo_atn_store() and __attr_fifo_atn_write().\n-- Set struct audio_stream::active for a recording stream to true when a\n   recording starts and set it to false when recording get stopped.  Do not\n   set/clear it within the body of read() because just being within read()\n   does not mean that recording is in progress.\n-- In tegra_audio_read() check for stop \u003d\u003d true before calling\n   start_recording_if_necessary(); this makes sure that if a user calls read()\n   after calling ioctl(TEGRA_AUDIO_IN_STOP) recording will not resume unless\n   ioctl(TEGRA_AUDIO_IN_START) gets called or the file is closed and\n   re-opened.\n-- Fixed TEGRA_AUDIO_IN_START\n-- In PIO mode enabled FIFOs before enabling interrupts as specified in the\n   TRM.\n-- Added missing break in tegra_audio_ioctl().\n-- Silenced some debug spew\n\nSigned-off-by: Iliyan Malchev \u003cmalchev@google.com\u003e\n

5673,"Make drag and drop create a single undo operation\n\nIf you drag and drop a widget you end up with two separate undo\noperations: One which inserts the widget in its new location and one\nwhich deletes it from its former location. If you drag a widget\nsomewhere and then change your mind and press Undo you will therefore\nend up with *two* versions of the dragged widgets since undoing just\nonce only undoes the source removal not the target addition.\n\nThis changeset fixes this. It\u0027s not a very clean fix since drag and\ndrop is a protocol where the drag source and the drop handler are\ndeliberately not connected. We now create a single undo context before\ncalling the layout helper\u0027s drop handler and when it has finished we\nthen remove the source still within the current undo context. This is\ndone by having the drag source register a cleanup handler with the\nglobal drag info object and this handler is invoked from within the\ndrop target\u0027s undo operation.\n\nThis means that we end up creating the undo unit on the tool side\nrather than in the layout helpers where more specific undo labels\nwere assigned. To deal with this there is a new function which\nproduces a suitable Undo name. It creates the name by considering\nwhether it\u0027s a move or copy as well as the unqualified names of the\ndragged element and the drop target. For example when dragging from\nthe palette you may end up with \Drop Button in LinearLayout\"" and if\ndragging a multiselection you may end up with \""Move Widgets in\nRelativeLayout\"" and so on.\n\nChange-Id: I242b51e5a9c7cd9eae55aa4139c510cb26b0e8fb\n"""

5746,"Fixes update of extras Bundle in new Locations for GPS Provider\n\nThis patch fixes the update of the extras Bundle in the Location object\neach time the platform derives a new GPS location and passes it to\nlistening applications via LocationListener.onLocationChanged().\n\nSometime between Android 1.6 and 2.1 a bug was introduced that stopped\nany extras calculated by the platform from being added into the Location\nobject which means they were never passed up to any LocationListeners\nfor the GPS Provider.  This manifested as an issue where the number of\nsatellites used to derive a fix always reported “0�? when retrieved from\nLocation.getExtras() (Issue 4810 on the Android Issues page -\nhttp://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id\u003d4810).\n\nSample code to be used within\nLocationListener.onLocationChanged(Location location) which demonstrates\nthis problem:\n\nBundle extras \u003d location.getExtras();\n\nInt numSats \u003d extras.getInt(\satellites\"");  //This always reports “0�?\n                                            //post 1.5 although in 1.5\n                                            //it properly reported the\n                                            //number of satellites used\n                                            //to derive this location\n\nThe “satellites�? extra key/value pair for Locations is defined in\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location.html#getExtras()\n\nThis patch modifies GPSLocationProvider.java to properly update the\nLocation object with the extras Bundle before the Location object is\npassed to any listening applications and therefore the number of\nsatellites used to derive a fix can now be retrieved properly through\nlocation.getExtras() (as shown in sample code above).

5801,"Fixes update of extras Bundle in new Locations for GPS Provider\n\nThis patch fixes the update of the extras Bundle in the Location object each time the platform derives a new GPS location and passes it to listening applications via LocationListener.onLocationChanged().  Sometime between Android 1.6 and 2.1 a bug was introduced that stopped any extras calculated by the platform from being added into the Location object which means they were never passed up to any LocationListeners for the GPS Provider.  This manifested as an issue where the number of satellites used to derive a fix always reported “0�? when retrieved from Location.getExtras() (Issue 4810 on the Android Issues page - http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id\u003d4810).\n\nSample code to be used within LocationListener.onLocationChanged(Location location) which demonstrates this problem:\n\nBundle extras \u003d location.getExtras();\n\nInt numSats \u003d extras.getInt(\satellites\"");  //This always reports “0�? post 1.5 although in 1.5 it properly reported the number of satellites used to derive this location\n\nThe “satellites�? extra key/value pair for Locations is defined in http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location.html#getExtras()\n\nThis patch modifies GPSLocationProvider.java to properly update the Location object with the extras Bundle before the Location object is passed to any listening applications and therefore the number of satellites used to derive a fix can now be retrieved properly through location.getExtras() (as shown in sample code above).  Therefore this patch fixes Issue 4810.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sean Barbeau \u003csjbarbeau@gmail.com\u003e\n"""

5848,DNS Proxy should not hang on addresses containing null bytes\n\nTwo bugs here:\n\n1.) The gethostbyaddr netd protocol was passing a binary address value\n    but the arguments are expected to be strings not containing\n    embedded nulls (or probably other special characters). This\n    happened reliably with IPv6 addresses which contained nulls. It\n    now expects an inet_ntop formatted address.\n\n2.) Although the gethostbyaddr code detected something was wrong it\n    wasn\u0027t doing any proper error handling leaving clients hanging\n    waiting for a response. It now sends back an empty response so\n    that clients can continue.\n\nA corresponding change will be necesssary in bionic for #1 for DNS\nproxying to work but given the fix for #2 the existing bionic code\nwill fall back to performing its own gethostbyaddr call.\n\nBug: 4344448\nChange-Id: I2a55bb0cd0f1b0670f25c0c93554578bb20404e3\n

This happens\nwhen you are at the end of a list and try to scroll further.\nThe problem is that you enter a switch statement with the\nmState variable set to STATE_PULL_DECAY. This will trigger\ncode in the switch statement that does some adjustments and\ncalculations but it does not change the value of mState to\nSTATE_IDLE or STATE_RECEDE after it\u0027s done. Hence it will\ncontinue to return to the same place and not stop updating\nsince the update() method signals for completion only when\nthe mState variable is set to STATE_IDLE.\n\nThe fix is changing the value of mState after the\nadjustments and calculations have been made.\n\nChange-Id: I57bc84ec12d43ca87a1163d94cb5b206a376a24e\n

5906,bluez a2dp - fix state machine synchronization\n\nUsing a worker thread implementation for A2DP means that if we don\u0027t\nhave some way to syncroniize state transitions we can get overlap of\nrequested command functions or lost signals. In order for the A2DP\nstate machine to function each command operation must complete before\nthe next is initiated or we will get errors caused by these out of\nsequence commands. And if we signal the thread when it is not waiting\non the condition the signal will be missed.\n\nThis could be partly resolved by implementing a queue but then there\nis an overhead with also implementing a wait mechamism for state\ntransitions. It\u0027s much easier and simpler to just hold the mutex\nduring command processing which also deals with the lost signals issue.\nThis may well not achieve the original goal of the worker thread\nimplementation but neither would a queue implementation. It looks\nlike this is just the way things are!\n
5907,Flashing with an offset\n\nThe existing fastboot protocol does not handle flashing partitions larger\nthan the RAM size.  To do this the flashing must be divided in multiple\ndownload/flash.  These are the set of changes needed to the fastboot protocol\nto support flashing with an offset and querying the client for the natural size\nto break the flashings into.\n\nThis is a design change.\nA sample implementation on the fastboot client and a bootloader will follow.\n\nAt a high level to flash a partition the fastboot client currently does\n\n\tread_file\n\tfastboot download:size_of_file\n\tfastboot flash:partition_name\n\nWith this change the fastboot client will do\n\n\tread_file\n\n\tfastboot getvar:downloadsize\n\tfastboot getvar:size-partition_name\n\tfastboot getvar:block-partition_name\n\n\tif (getvar_failed or size_of_file \u003c downloadsize)\n\t\tfastboot download:size_of_file\n\t\tfastboot flash:partition_name\n\n\telse\n\t\ttransfer_size \u003d (downloadsize / block_size) * block_size\n\t\twhile (offset \u003c size_of_file)\n\t\t      \tfastboot download:transfer_size\n\t\t\tfastboot flash:partition_name:offset\n\t\t\toffset +\u003d transfer_size\n\nThe if-check insures that the current behavior is maintained and is sufficient\nfor backward compatibility.\n\nThe changes for the bootloader are to support the new variables :\n\tdownloadsize\n\tblock-\u003cname\u003e\n\tsize-\u003cname\u003e\nAnd to handle the optional offset in the flash command.\n\nSigned-off-by: Tom Rix \u003cTom.Rix@windriver.com\u003e\n

This happened\nbecause the layout editor treats the FQCN and the XML node name as\nequivalent but in the case of the include tag the FQCN was set to\nnull instead of \include\"".\n\nSecond the \""layout\"" attribute would not get copied because it is NOT\nin the Android namespace and the code to copy attributes ended up\nwith an empty-string namespace which was not handled correctly.\n\nThird when copied the \""layout\"" attribute would end up with the\nnamespace \""ns:\"" because the code to create attribute nodes always\ncreated namespaced attribute nodes rather than a plain attribute node\nwhen the namespace is null.\n\nChange-Id: Ibd34212517615aa8ec79abe14bca765cdca525f6\n"""

6248,Improve custom class loading failure handling\n\nFor background see\nhttp://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id\u003d13389\n\nWe currently both load and instantiate custom view classes under the\nsame try/catch block and if there is a failure the user is informed\nthat the class could not be -found-. However in many cases the real\nfailure is in actually -instantiating- the class so telling the user\nthat the class could not be found is misleading and can make the user\nhunt down library dependencies checking jar contents etc.\n\nThis changeset improves the situation in the following ways:\n\n- The code to load and instantiate are handled separately and the\n  list of missing classes is kept separate from the list of\n  uninstantiatable classes.\n\n- The error display in the layout editor lists these two categories\n  separately.\n\n- For instantiation errors we dig up the root cause and log that\n  one. The error display points to the Error Log for more details.\n\n- If the class looks like it might be a custom view class (rather than\n  a loading or instantiation failure in one of the Android or Add-Ons\n  classes) then the error message also includes a tip about using\n  View.isInEditMode to try to do less work for design time rendering.\n\nChange-Id: I947ad91e0d7973e9c3aefed1824f61c92c5fb1ed\n

6274,WifiApDialog has wrong lifecycle\n\nBest way to reproduce the problem:\n1. Go to Settings -\u003e Wireless -\u003e Tethering.. -\u003e Portable Wi-fi ..\n -\u003e Configure ..\n2. Click on Security so the picker dialog opens\n3. Press home button\n4. Go to Settings. (App crashes)\n\nThe problem is that the Spinner in WifiApDialog.java tries to dismiss\nthe dialog after the dialog has been removed by the window manager\nbecause of leak detection.\n\nThe reason this happens is that the WifiApDialog that\u0027s created in\nWifiApSettings.java is created in such a way that the life-cycle of\nthe Dialog is handled by the base class Activity. That causes the\ndialog problem that the WifiApDialog is removed in onDestroy() of\nWifiApSettings which will send an event that will execute\nonDetachFromWindow() on the Spinner instance in the future (this is\nhandled in ViewRoot.java). That message won\u0027t be processed until the\nWindowManager has removed the view (the Spinner dialog) because of\nleak detection and once the onDetachedFromWindow() on Spinner\nexecutes it dialog has already been removed.\n\nThe problem can be solved by handling the life-cycle of the\nWifiApDialog completely in WifiApSettings analog to WifiSettings.\n\nChange-Id: I6c5eea9d155589670f9b819efc28eb2e397e72ac\n

This will even happen on incoming skbs as it\nlooks into the skb via xt_socket magic to see who owns it.\nIf an skb is lost it will be assigned to uid\u003d0.\n\nTo control what sockets of what UIDs are tagged by what one uses:\n  echo t $sock_fd $accounting_tag $the_billed_uid \\\n     \u003e /proc/net/xt_qtaguid/ctrl\n So whenever an skb belongs to a sock_fd it will be accounted against\n   $the_billed_uid\n  and matching stats will show up under the uid with the given\n   $accounting_tag.\n\nBecause the number of allocations for the stats structs is not that big:\n  ~500 apps * 32 per app\nwe\u0027ll just do it atomic. This avoids walking lists many times and\nthe fancy worker thread handling. Slabs will grow when needed later.\n\nIt use netdevice and inetaddr notifications instead of hooks in the core dev\ncode to track when a device comes and goes. This removes the need for\nexposed iface_stat.h.\n\nPut procfs dirs in /proc/net/xt_qtaguid/\n  ctrl\n  stats\n  iface_stat/\u003ciface\u003e/...\nThe uid stats are obtainable in ./stats.\n\nChange-Id: I01af4fd91c8de651668d3decb76d9bdc1e343919\nSigned-off-by: JP Abgrall \u003cjpa@google.com\u003e\n

6360,nmi: fix clock comparator revalidation\n\ncommit e8129c642155616d9e2160a75f103e127c8c3708 upstream.\n\nOn each machine check all registers are revalidated. The save area for\nthe clock comparator however only contains the upper most seven bytes\nof the former contents if valid.\nTherefore the machine check handler uses a store clock instruction to\nget the current time and writes that to the clock comparator register\nwhich in turn will generate an immediate timer interrupt.\nHowever within the lowcore the expected time of the next timer\ninterrupt is stored. If the interrupt happens before that time the\nhandler won\u0027t be called. In turn the clock comparator won\u0027t be\nreprogrammed and therefore the interrupt condition stays pending which\ncauses an interrupt loop until the expected time is reached.\n\nOn NOHZ machines this can result in unresponsive machines since the\ntime of the next expected interrupted can be a couple of days in the\nfuture.\n\nTo fix this just revalidate the clock comparator register with the\nexpected value.\nIn addition the special handling for udelay must be changed as well.\n\nSigned-off-by: Heiko Carstens \u003cheiko.carstens@de.ibm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Martin Schwidefsky \u003cschwidefsky@de.ibm.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

6397,"Make the default backup configuration \disabled; local transport selected\""\n\nBy default out of the box an Android build will have the backup mechanism in\nits \""disabled\"" state and pointed to the LocalTransport test transport.  We\ndo not want retail devices built without the Google backend to have backup\nenabled out of the box; it would cause them to gradually grind away the\ncache partition for no good reason.  On those devices with this change\ndevelopers would need to enable backup manually (possibly using the normal\nSettings UI; more probably using the \u0027bmgr\u0027 shell tool) but would no longer\nalso have to manually configure the active transport name.\n\nDevice vendors producing Google-enabled products will simply use resource\noverlays to configure the default state and transport name for their builds.\nWhen building a product that points to the Google backup transport by default\nthe \""def_backup_enabled\"" boolean resource should still be set to \u0027false\u0027 --\nthe Google backup disclosure activity supplied by GSF will take care of\nenabling the backup services if the user opts in to it.

6529,Bluetooth: Fix connection establishment with low security requirement\n\nThe Bluetooth 2.1 specification introduced four different security modes\nthat can be mapped using Legacy Pairing and Simple Pairing. With the\nusage of Simple Pairing it is required that all connections (except\nthe ones for SDP) are encrypted. So even the low security requirement\nmandates an encrypted connection when using Simple Pairing. When using\nLegacy Pairing (for Bluetooth 2.0 devices and older) this is not required\nsince it causes interoperability issues.\n\nTo support this properly the low security requirement translates into\ndifferent host controller transactions depending if Simple Pairing is\nsupported or not. However in case of Simple Pairing the command to\nswitch on encryption after a successful authentication is not triggered\nfor the low security mode. This patch fixes this and actually makes\nthe logic to differentiate between Simple Pairing and Legacy Pairing\na lot simpler.\n\nBased on a report by Ville Tervo \u003cville.tervo@nokia.com\u003e\n\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann \u003cmarcel@holtmann.org\u003e\n

The virtual address of the area can be queried and used for\nDMA operations by the client which created it.\n\nAs with the Linux vm_area structures it is the responsibility of whichever\ncode creates an area to ensure that it is populated with appropriate\ntranslations.\n\nDomains\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nA domain in the IOVMM system is similar to a process in a standard CPU\nvirtual memory system; it represents the entire range of virtual addresses\nwhich may be allocated and used for translation. Depending on hardware\ncapabilities one or more domains may be resident and available for\ntranslation. IOVMM areas are allocated from IOVMM domains.\n\nWhenever a DMA operation is performed to or from an IOVMM area its parent\ndomain must be made resident prior to commencing the operation.\n\nClients\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nI/O VMM clients represent any entity which needs to be able to allocate\nand map system memory into I/O virtual space. Clients are created by name\nand may be created as part of a \share group\"" where all clients created\nin the same share group will observe the same I/O virtual space (i.e. all\nwill use the same IOVMM domain). This is similar to threads inside a process\nin the CPU virtual memory manager.\n\nThe callers of the I/O VMM system are responsible for deciding on the\ngranularity of client creation and share group definition; depending on the\nspecific usage model expected by the caller it may be appropriate to create\nan IOVMM client per task (if the caller represents an ioctl\u0027able interface\nto user land) an IOVMM client per driver instance a common IOVMM client\nfor an entire bus or a global IOVMM client for an OS subsystem (e.g. the DMA\nmapping interface).\n\nEach client is responsible for ensuring that its IOVMM client\u0027s translation is\nresident on the system prior to performing DMA operations using the IOVMM\naddresses. This is accomplished by preceding all DMA operations for the client\nwith a call to tegra_iovmm_client_lock (or tegra_iovmm_client_trylock)\nand following all operations (once complete) with a call to\ntegra_iovmm_client_unlock. In this regard clients are cooperatively context-\nswitched and are expected to behave appropriately.\n\nDevices\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nI/O VMM devices are the physical hardware which is responsible for performing\nthe I/O virtual-to-physical translation.\n\nDevices are responsible for domain management: the mapping and unmapping\noperations needed to make translations resident in the domain (including\nany TLB shootdown or cache invalidation needed to ensure coherency) locking\nand unlocking domains as they are made resident by clients into the devices\u0027\naddress space(s) and allocating and deallocating the domain objects.\n\nDevices are responsible for the allocation and deallocation of domains to\nallow coalescing of multiple client share groups into a single domain. For\nexample if the device\u0027s hardware only allows a single address space to\nbe translated system-wide performing full flushes and invalidates of the\ntranslation at every client switch may be prohibitively expensive. In these\ncircumstances a legal implementation of the IOVMM interface includes\nreturning the same domain for all clients on the system (regardless of\nthe originally-specified share group).\n\nIn this respect a client can be assured that it will share an address space\nwith all of the other clients in its share group; however it may also share\nthis address space with other clients too.\n\nMultiple devices may be present in a system; a device should return a NULL\ndomain if it is incapable of servicing the client when it is asked to\nallocate a domain.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIOVMM Client API\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\ntegra_iovmm_alloc_client - Called to create a new IOVMM client object; the\n implementation may create a new domain or return an existing one depending on\n both the device and the share group.\n\ntegra_iovmm_free_client - Frees a client.\n\ntegra_iovmm_client_lock - Makes a client\u0027s translations resident in the IOVMM\n device for subsequent DMA operations.

6554,Do not explicity disconnect Data during power down for 1x.\n\nIn 1x if the data call is torn down before radio power off modem will\nhave to send a data call release and change to initialization state followed\nby idle state and send out power down registration. If the power off request is sent\nto the modem during Initialization state after call release there is a chance that\nmodem does not perform power down registration.\n\nInstead if we directly initiate a power down modem just sets a power down registration\nbit in the release order. This change also optimizes the power down procedure in 1x by\nletting the modem handle data call release during power down.\n\nChange-Id: I0f083cc3b005ec1e64105350abb43d10583b0881\n

6712,Input: add detailed multi-touch finger data report protocol\n\nIn order to utilize the full power of the new multi-touch devices a\nway to report detailed finger data to user space is needed. This patch\nadds a multi-touch (MT) protocol which allows drivers to report details\nfor an arbitrary number of fingers.\n\nThe driver sends a SYN_MT_REPORT event via the input_mt_sync() function\nwhen a complete finger has been reported.\n\nIn order to stay compatible with existing applications the data\nreported in a finger packet must not be recognized as single-touch\nevents. In addition all finger data must bypass input filtering\nsince subsequent events of the same type refer to different fingers.\n\nA set of ABS_MT events with the desired properties are defined. The\nevents are divided into categories to allow for partial implementation.\nThe minimum set consists of ABS_MT_TOUCH_MAJOR ABS_MT_POSITION_X and\nABS_MT_POSITION_Y which allows for multiple fingers to be tracked.\nIf the device supports it the ABS_MT_WIDTH_MAJOR may be used to provide\nthe size of the approaching finger. Anisotropy and direction may be\nspecified with ABS_MT_TOUCH_MINOR ABS_MT_WIDTH_MINOR and\nABS_MT_ORIENTATION. Devices with more granular information may specify\ngeneral shapes as blobs i.e. as a sequence of rectangular shapes\ngrouped together by a ABS_MT_BLOB_ID. Finally the ABS_MT_TOOL_TYPE\nmay be used to specify whether the touching tool is a finger or a pen.\n\nSigned-off-by: Henrik Rydberg \u003crydberg@euromail.se\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov \u003cdtor@mail.ru\u003e\n

6812,PROTOTYPE: Runtime resource overlay iteration 2.\n\nIteration 2 of runtime resource overlay adds the following.\n\n1) The concept of skins ie overlay packages which may be\n   enabled/disabled in runtime.\n\n2) Support for multiple overlay/skin packages to be loaded\n   simultaneously.\n\nThis implementation is a proof-of-concept prototype intended as basis\nfor further discussions. The code is intentionally left unpolished and\nexplores the following design choices.\n\n1) Locating skin packages is done in AssetManager. This design keeps\n   skin handling nicely confined to the native layers. On the other\n   hand since each AssetManager only has knowledge about the current\n   process\u0027 application package extra work must be done to locate\n   appropriate skins to load along with original .apk. By shifting part\n   of the skin responsibility to the PackageManager with its global\n   knowledge of all installed packages this could be avoided.\n\n2) Skins may target the system resources (framework-res.apk) or\n   application .apks. Any number of overlay packages may be loaded per\n   process but at most one system skin (globally) and one application\n   skin (per application) may be enabled at a time. This implementation\n   loads all available skins per application even if only one is\n   enabled which allows skins to be switched easily analogue to eg\n   language or orientation changes. However disabled/latent skins\n   waste memory. By instead only loading the actually enabled skin\n   package no memory is wasted and very little code in ResourceTypes\n   and AssetManager would have to be modified. The drawback is that\n   processes must be killed and restarted with a new set of packages\n   when switching skins. This should be of no concern for applications\n   given the Activity life cycle but may lead to bad user experience\n   when changing the system skin.\n\n3) The set of currently enabled skins has been added to the\n   Configuration Java class. This allows changes to the set of enabled\n   skins to propagate using the existing flow for other changes to\n   Configuration. It also somewhat breaks the design of Configuration:\n   previously all information in Configuration was applicable to all\n   applications but enabled skin information is unique per application.\n   The current design also requires knowledge about package names be\n   added to Configuration. If PackageManager is responsible for loading\n   (only) the enabled skin packages implying a process reboot strategy\n   the changes to Configuration could be replaced with a dedicated call\n   to ActivityManager which would force a process restart.\n\n4) Idmap files are created by user zygote which seem to have dropped\n   its privileged file access rights ending up with files created\n   by user nobody. In a future iteration where skin packages may be\n   installed by the end user any app_XXX user may be required to create\n   idmap files. This leads to a world-writeable /data/resource-cache.\n   If the PackageManager were responsible for loading skin packages it\n   could also ensure idmap files are up-to-date prior to application\n   execution which would allow write permission to /data/resource-cache\n   be limited to user system.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n1) Skin and overlay packages are regular packages; the only difference\n   is the inclusion of a \u003cskin\u003e or \u003coverlay\u003e tag in AndroidManifest.xml.\n   This renders the aapt -o flag introduced in commit 57f4b77\n   obsolete.\n\n1) This commit performs no caching.\n\n2) For security reasons only skin packages in /system are considered.\n\nChange-Id: Ib3deb941edebf09d7345ab06cfe3cf16b3ebe42c\n

First add a \""Flatten Hierarchy\"" option which\ncan take an entire hierarchy of layout widgets and flatten it down to\na single top level RelativeLayout where the constraints attempt to\nreflect the original layout. (This isn\u0027t always possible since some\nlayout managers offer features not possible to express in\nRelativeLayout such as a LinearLayout with multiple different\nweights) but it often works or is at least a good start.  (This work\nis ongoing but since my changeset is getting large I want to check in\nthis snapshot since the functionality is better than what is in the\ntrunk.)\n\nThis changeset also adds a new refactoring: Change Widget Type. This\ncan be applied to a selection of elements and it will convert the\nwidget type to the new target widget type. It will also remove any\nattributes that are not valid for the new layout.\n\nIt also improves the wizards which display the possible target types.\nFor Change Widget Type it will first offer \""related\"" widgets so for\nan AnalogClock it will first offer Digital Clock for a checkbox it\nwill offer a checked text view and a radio button etc.\n\nIn addition it will list Views and Layouts that it finds in any\nlibrary jars (except for the builtin Android ones) and any custom\nview classes in the project.\n\nThere is also now some preliminary support for refactoring unit\ntests. These tests must be run as Eclipse plugin tests since they\nutilize the XML model (and the XML model cannot be mocked). The test\ninfrastructure reads source XML files applies the refactoring change\nlist to them and diffs the output with the known expected output\n(also stored as result XML files in the test project).\n\nFinally there are a number of fixes and improvements to the shared\nrefactoring code.\n\nChange-Id: I0974653e530dfb4feb625e0eef8257c29d50614b\n"""

6993,CTS: Set camera default framerate to video recorder for android.hardware.cts.CameraTest#testLockUnlock\n\n- Video recorder is started without setting framerate first. Thus hardcoded default framerete value is set in StagefrightRecorder and then StagefrightRecorder trying to configure Camera hardware with this hardcoded value (20 fps). But there isn\u0027t guarantee that Camera hardware can support 20 fps. If not CTS will fail.\n\n- As a solution default Camera hardware framerate can be used to configure Video recorder.\n

6995,"Camera: Resolve conflict between setPreviewFpsRange and setPreviewFrameRate\n\n- Currently Camera interface shares two different methods to set framerate -\n  \PreviewFpsRange\"" and \""PreviewFrameRate\"". Many existing Camera applications\n  and CTS tests expects that Camera hardware has it\u0027s default framerate setting.\n  Thus CameraHardware should provide default values for both framerate\n  methods at the same time. Camera application usually gets default parameters\n  array from Camera hardware changing just one of the framerate parameters and then\n  sends modified parameters array back to hardware. But camera hardware cannot recognize\n  which parameter is the correct one to use for it\u0027s framerate setting - one of them is obsolete.\n  The only possible way to solve this is every hardware implementation to implement\n  it\u0027s own workaround of this conflict by tracking framerate setting changes.\n\n- General solution: Simple sanity check is added in Android core. When application\n  uses one method to set framerate data owned by other method is deleted at the same time.\n"""

7086,[ARM] tegra: suspend: add support for LP0 and LP1 suspend modes\n\nin both LP0 and LP1 SDRAM is placed into self-refresh. in order to safely\nperform this transition the final shutdown procedure responsible for\n\n  * turning off the MMU and L1 data cache\n  * putting memory into self-refresh\n  * setting the DDR pads to the lowest power state\n  * and turning off PLLs\n\nis copied into IRAM (at the address TEGRA_IRAM_BASE + SZ_4K) at the\nstart of the suspend process.\n\nin LP1 mode (like LP2) the CPU is reset and executes the code specified\nat the EVP reset vector. since SDRAM is in self-refresh this code must\nalso be located in IRAM and it must re-enable DRAM before restoring the\nfull context. in this implementation it enables the CPU on PLLP enables\nPLLC and PLLM restores the SCLK burst policy and jumps to the LP2 reset\nvector to restore the rest of the system (MMU PLLX coresite etc.). the\nLP2 reset vector is expected to be found in PMC_SCRATCH1 and is\ninitialized during system-bootup\n\nin LP0 mode the core voltage domain is also shutoff. as a result all\nof the volatile state in the core voltage domain (e.g. pinmux registers\nclock registers etc.) must be saved to memory so that it can be restored\nafter the system resumes. a limited set of wakeups are available from LP0\nand the correct levels for the wakeups must be programmed into the PMC\nwakepad configuration register prior to system shutdown. on resume the\nsystem resets into the boot ROM and the boot ROM restores SDRAM and other\nsystem state using values saved during kernel initialization in the PMC\nscratch registers.\n\nresuming from LP0 requires the boot ROM to supply a signed recovery codeblob\nto the kernel; the kernel expects that the length and address of this blob\nis supplied with the lp0_vec\u003d command line argument; if not present suspend-\nto-LP0 will be disabled\n\nfor simplicity the outer cache is shutdown for both LP0 and LP1; it\nis possible to optimize the LP1 routine to bypass outer cache shutdown\nand restart\n\nv2 fixes from Vik Kasivajhula \u003ctkasivajhula@nvidia.com\u003e:\n* restore PLLC during LP1 resume\n* fix typo which set the CPU clock burst policy to PLLM rather than PLLP\n\nv3 fixes from Vik Kasivajhula \u003ctkasivajhula@nvidia.com\u003e:\n* shut off the MMU during LP2 to avoid races between the flow controller\n  and the instruction prefetcher\n\nv3 fixes from Scott Williams \u003cscwilliams@nvidia.com\u003e:\n* separate CPU-specific code from SoC-specific code\n\nv4 fixes from Alex Frid (afrid@nvidia.com):\n* refactor PMC modes to avoid dependency on polarity of external pull-ups/\n  pull-downs for the power request lines\n* save/restore CPU power-off timer\n\nv4 fixes from Bharat Nihalani (bnihalani@nvidia.com):\n* program deep power down pad sampling\n\nChange-Id: I17fe667ee3fb5cf68084f51dad555ff9d5c84024\nSigned-off-by: Gary King \u003cgking@nvidia.com\u003e\n

7150,Allow a surface to be re-parceled\n\nWhen a surface is originally created in SurfaceFlinger the system\nreturns a SurfaceControl object which is a wrapper that can be\nused to create a surface.  This gets parceled to the client process\nwhich uses the data to create an actual surface but does not create\na SurfaceControl.  Thus every process with access to a surface will\nhave either a Surface or a SurfaceControl but never both.\n\nHowever the parceling code assumes that there is always a SurfaceControl\nand uses its information to perform the parcel.  This works for server-side\nsurfaces which have a SurfaceControl but if an attempt is made to re-parcel\na client-side surface the SurfaceControl object is null so the parcel fails.\nHowever a client-side object will contain a Surface object instead which\nstill contains all the information necessary to perform the parcel.\n\nThis patch adds the ability to parcel from a Surface in addition to a\nSurfaceControl meaning that a Surface received by another process can be\ncorrectly re-parceled to a third process.\n\nChange-Id: I18884e91232d033d9db607a594bf6bfee4224a27\n

7165,"[ARM] tegra: add I/O virtual memory manager interface (iovmm)\n\nThe Tegra IOVMM is an interface to allow device drivers and subsystems in\nthe kernel to manage the virtual memory spaces visible to I/O devices.\n\nThe interface has been designed to be scalable to allow for I/O virtual\nmemory hardware which exists in one or more limited apertures of the address\nspace (e.g. a small aperture in physical address space which can perform\nMMU-like remapping) up to complete virtual addressing with multiple\naddress spaces and memory protection.\n\nThe interface has been designed to be similar to the Linux virtual memory\nsystem; however operations which would be difficult to implement or\nnonsensical for DMA devices (e.g. copy-on-write) are not present and\nAPIs have been added to allow for management of multiple simultaneous\nactive address spaces.\n\nThe API is broken into four principal objects: areas clients domains and\ndevices.\n\nAreas\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nAn area is a contiguous region of the virtual address space which can be\nfilled with virtual-to-physical translations (and optionally protection\nattributes). The virtual address of the area can be queried and used for\nDMA operations by the client which created it.\n\nAs with the Linux vm_area structures it is the responsibility of whichever\ncode creates an area to ensure that it is populated with appropriate\ntranslations.\n\nDomains\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nA domain in the IOVMM system is similar to a process in a standard CPU\nvirtual memory system; it represents the entire range of virtual addresses\nwhich may be allocated and used for translation. Depending on hardware\ncapabilities one or more domains may be resident and available for\ntranslation. IOVMM areas are allocated from IOVMM domains.\n\nWhenever a DMA operation is performed to or from an IOVMM area its parent\ndomain must be made resident prior to commencing the operation.\n\nClients\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nI/O VMM clients represent any entity which needs to be able to allocate\nand map system memory into I/O virtual space. Clients are created by name\nand may be created as part of a \share group\"" where all clients created\nin the same share group will observe the same I/O virtual space (i.e. all\nwill use the same IOVMM domain). This is similar to threads inside a process\nin the CPU virtual memory manager.\n\nThe callers of the I/O VMM system are responsible for deciding on the\ngranularity of client creation and share group definition; depending on the\nspecific usage model expected by the caller it may be appropriate to create\nan IOVMM client per task (if the caller represents an ioctl\u0027able interface\nto user land) an IOVMM client per driver instance a common IOVMM client\nfor an entire bus or a global IOVMM client for an OS subsystem (e.g. the DMA\nmapping interface).\n\nEach client is responsible for ensuring that its IOVMM client\u0027s translation is\nresident on the system prior to performing DMA operations using the IOVMM\naddresses. This is accomplished by preceding all DMA operations for the client\nwith a call to tegra_iovmm_client_lock (or tegra_iovmm_client_trylock)\nand following all operations (once complete) with a call to\ntegra_iovmm_client_unlock. In this regard clients are cooperatively context-\nswitched and are expected to behave appropriately.\n\nDevices\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\nI/O VMM devices are the physical hardware which is responsible for performing\nthe I/O virtual-to-physical translation.\n\nDevices are responsible for domain management: the mapping and unmapping\noperations needed to make translations resident in the domain (including\nany TLB shootdown or cache invalidation needed to ensure coherency) locking\nand unlocking domains as they are made resident by clients into the devices\u0027\naddress space(s) and allocating and deallocating the domain objects.\n\nDevices are responsible for the allocation and deallocation of domains to\nallow coalescing of multiple client share groups into a single domain. For\nexample if the device\u0027s hardware only allows a single address space to\nbe translated system-wide performing full flushes and invalidates of the\ntranslation at every client switch may be prohibitively expensive. In these\ncircumstances a legal implementation of the IOVMM interface includes\nreturning the same domain for all clients on the system (regardless of\nthe originally-specified share group).\n\nIn this respect a client can be assured that it will share an address space\nwith all of the other clients in its share group; however it may also share\nthis address space with other clients too.\n\nMultiple devices may be present in a system; a device should return a NULL\ndomain if it is incapable of servicing the client when it is asked to\nallocate a domain.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIOVMM Client API\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n\ntegra_iovmm_alloc_client - Called to create a new IOVMM client object; the\n implementation may create a new domain or return an existing one depending on\n both the device and the share group.\n\ntegra_iovmm_free_client - Frees a client.\n\ntegra_iovmm_client_lock - Makes a client\u0027s translations resident in the IOVMM\n device for subsequent DMA operations.

ViewInfos with null keys at the top are handled one way;\nViewInfo subtrees that introduce null keys further down are handled\nanother and it attempts to match up elements in the UiViewElementNode\nhierarchy with ViewInfo objects. If it cannot match them one to one\nit will create a single \bounding box\"" view containing all unmatched\nViewInfos. This will for example produce a single box out of included\n\u003cmerge\u003e views.\n\nThis changeset also handles multiple includes.

This fails typically when there is a file\nindexer (e.g. anti-virus) scanning the new folder so we can\u0027t\nmove that folder.\nThe new logic is to try to move the old folder first into a\ntemp folder. If the fail move we have a lock on the old folder\nand ask the user to fix it manually. They probably have a file\nopened and it\u0027s a legit issue to report. Once that succeeded\nwe can directly unzip the archive into the final destination\nwithout using a temp unzip location thus avoiding the common\n\""indexer in progress\"" issue.\nIn case the unzip operation fails we try to copy (not move) the\nold folder back.\n\nChange-Id: I5ed67ff626532fe7cc48a45e87d1dbaf6954f28a\n"""

7235,"Prevent adding children into AdapterViews\n\nAs reported in issue 13042 it\u0027s possible to add views into\nAdapterViews such as ListView.

7419,Not possible to follow links after pinch-zoom in browser\n\nA pinch-zoom may set the browser in drawIsPaused\nstate which prevent the screen from being updated.\n\nA pinch-zoom starts with a call to startDrag\nwhich calls pauseUpdatePicture which in turn sets\nWebView in the drawIsPaused state. The pinch-zoom\nends by invoking onScaleEnd which sets mTouchMode to\nTOUCH_PINCH_DRAG. When the gesture finishes\nonTouchEvent is called with action MotionEvent.ACTION_UP.\nBut mTouchMode equals TOUCH_PINCH_DRAG and that case is\nnot handled so resumeUpdatePicture is never called.\nThe function resumeUpdatePicture has to be called in\norder to reset the drawIsPaused state.\n\nThe solution is to call resumeUpdatePicture\nin onTouchEvent if mTouchMode is equal to\nTOUCH_PINCH_DRAG in the MotionEvent.ACTION_UP case.\n\nReproduce:\n1. Open www.google.com in classic view\n2. Use pinch-zoom to zoom-in and zoom-out\n3. Release fingers straight up.\n4. Click a link to go to a new page. The new page does not appear.\n5. Fling or zoom using zoom-buttons to make\nthe new page be displayed on screen.\n\nNote: In step 3 it is important to release straight up in order\nto not trigger a fling.\n\nChange-Id: I4e095de9d4a05e043fbe39e9c665e9f584a723bf\n

7465,Accumulate rendering errors and ensure they are always shown\n\nThere are some scenarios where rendering failures (such as an NPE in\nthe layout lib) will not appear in the error display and it will not\nappear in the Error Log.\n\nIn addition we now get fidelity warnings from the layout library\n(warning about Android code using graphics operations not supported by\nthe layout preview) and these should all be displayed to the user\nwith a proper explanation.\n\nTo solve these problems this changeset replaces the layout logger\nwith a new logger which:\n\n(1) Writes all exceptions to the AdtPlug.log(Throwable) method which\nresults in the full exception being captured in the Error Log\n\n(2) Accumulates all errors warnings and fidelity warnings\n\n(3) Provides a summary of ALL the problems at the end such that they\nare all displayed (in decreasing order of severity) for the user\nrather than the last one clobbering them all.\n\nThe logger also records whether exceptions were logged and if so the\nlast line of the error display indicates that further details can be\nfound in Window \u003e Show View \u003e Error Log.\n\nFinally the old logger was a member of the GraphicalEditorPart but\nthis is a lightweight object so there is no need to cache it and in\nfact we don\u0027t want other types of rendering (such as preview\nrendering) popping open the error display area.\n\nChange-Id: Ia00978a725cb7e7ec2dcfbf9e868df2a5136efc0\n

This fails typically when there is a file\nindexer (e.g. anti-virus) scanning the new folder so we can\u0027t\nmove that folder.\nThe new logic is to try to move the old folder first into a\ntemp folder. If the fail move we have a lock on the old folder\nand ask the user to fix it manually. They probably have a file\nopened and it\u0027s a legit issue to report. Once that succeeded\nwe can directly unzip the archive into the final destination\nwithout using a temp unzip location thus avoiding the common\n\""indexer in progress\"" issue.\nIn case the unzip operation fails we try to copy (not move) the\nold folder back.\n\nChange-Id: I4fd862147cf7e0813eeef77a8332c0ce4f97a836\n"""

7725,cpufreq: interactive: New \u0027interactive\u0027 governor\n\nThis governor is designed for latency-sensitive workloads such as\ninteractive user interfaces.  The interactive governor aims to be\nsignificantly more responsive to ramp CPU quickly up when CPU-intensive\nactivity begins.\n\nExisting governors sample CPU load at a particular rate typically\nevery X ms.  This can lead to under-powering UI threads for the period of\ntime during which the user begins interacting with a previously-idle system\nuntil the next sample period happens.\n\nThe \u0027interactive\u0027 governor uses a different approach. Instead of sampling\nthe CPU at a specified rate the governor will check whether to scale the\nCPU frequency up soon after coming out of idle.  When the CPU comes out of\nidle a timer is configured to fire within 1-2 ticks.  If the CPU is very\nbusy from exiting idle to when the timer fires then we assume the CPU is\nunderpowered and ramp to MAX speed.\n\nIf the CPU was not sufficiently busy to immediately ramp to MAX speed then\nthe governor evaluates the CPU load since the last speed adjustment\nchoosing the highest value between that longer-term load or the short-term\nload since idle exit to determine the CPU speed to ramp to.\n\nA realtime thread is used for scaling up giving the remaining tasks the\nCPU performance benefit unlike existing governors which are more likely to\nschedule rampup work to occur after your performance starved tasks have\ncompleted.\n\nThe tuneables for this governor are:\n/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/interactive/min_sample_time:\n\tThe minimum amount of time to spend at the current frequency before\n\tramping down. This is to ensure that the governor has seen enough\n\thistoric CPU load data to determine the appropriate workload.\n\tDefault is 80000 uS.\n/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/interactive/go_maxspeed_load\n\tThe CPU load at which to ramp to max speed.  Default is 85.\n\nChange-Id: Ib2b362607c62f7c56d35f44a9ef3280f98c17585\nSigned-off-by: Mike Chan \u003cmike@android.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Todd Poynor \u003ctoddpoynor@google.com\u003e\nBug: 3152864\n

7747,ADT: The image given to layoutlib now shares data with ImageData\n\nWe now create a custom BufferedImage that also includes a reusable\nImageData to generate SWT images. While there is still the AWT to\nSWT conversion at least most buffers aren\u0027t re-allocated every\ntime during animation. The only new allocation is the one done\nin the Image constructor to pass the ImageData content to the native\nimage object.\n\nThis also fixes the tearing issue introduced in the previous\ncommit by calling ImageOverlay.setImage from the animation\nlistener callback. This should not be done in the UI thread\nrunnable as each rendering reuse the same bitmap.\nWhen the animation listener callback returns the image\nwill be reused for a new rendering so it\u0027s content will\nchange.\n\nAlso fixes the windows rendering by computing the proper\nband offset based on the SWT palette Data.\n\nChange-Id: Id57a3696bd92441271f6bee9681edefd12140b02\n

This makes more sense\n  as there are now other listeners to the resource changes (hyperlinks)\n  that access the resource list in their listeners which wouldn\u0027t work\n  previously.\n  This also makes the code cleaner as the previous method had to query\n  the repo for items and return a list of new ones which was kinda\n  crappy.

The PM_WKST_x\nregisters indicate the source of a wake-up event and need to be cleared\nafter a wake-up event occurs. When the PM_WKST_x registers are read and\nbefore they are cleared it is possible that another wake-up event\ncould occur causing another bit to be set in one of the PM_WKST_x\nregisters. If this did occur after reading a PM_WKST_x register then\nthe CPU would miss this event and get stuck forever in a loop waiting\nfor that PM_WKST_x register to clear.\n\nThis patch address the above race conditions that would result in a\nhang.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jon Hunter \u003cjon-hunter@ti.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Mike Chan \u003cmike@android.com\u003e\n

This change will make it\neasier to develop CTS in the open since adding test packages\nand applications will no longer require multiple project changes.\n\nAnother alternative was to move the entire cts.mk file to the\nCTS project but since the Makefile is in flux in the master branch\nso much that I\u0027ve decided to simplify things by only including\nthe test case list to avoid merge issues.\n\nAlso I decided to keep this in a separate Makefile rather than\nstuffing the definitions in the CTS Android.mk.

With this change the correct toolchain and vendor directories\nwill be reached regardless of current working directory when sourcing\nenvsetup.sh thus making it easier to source envsetup.sh and deciding\non target product/build variant from a module subdirectory.\n\nSigned-off-by: Christian Bejram \u003cchristian.bejram@stericsson.com\u003e\n

8229,"Include View Support\n\nAdd improved support for includes. You can now view and edit a layout\nwithin another containing layout. On a page with includes you can\ndouble click to warp into the included layout and it will be shown\nwithin the container layout (but with a semi-translucent mask to make\nit obvious that you are editing only the included content not the\ncontainer.)\n\nYou can also right click on a view and choose \Show Included In\""\nwhich is a pull-right which lists all the other layouts that are\nincluding this view. (If there are no such views the menu item will\nbe empty).\n\nIn addition this changeset adds code to detect if there are cycles in\nthe includes and if so adds a problem marker in the Problems view\nlisting the offending chain of includes.\n\nThis is all managed by a new \""IncludeFinder\"" class which listens for\nresource file edits (so it only kicks in when you save an XML file\nnot after each XML edit). It scans layout XML files for includes and\nmaintains a map of file includes. This is done such that it can very\nquickly provide a list of all files that are including a given target\nfile. This list is also persisted across IDE sessions via a project\nproperty.\n\nAlso fixes outline-expansion to ensure that the outline always shows\nthe top level children.\n\nNote: The include-relationships are based on the base layouts (the\nones in layouts/ not in customized versions in layout-land\nlayout-port etc.)\n\nChange-Id: I710560f03f7e214219669af8ffba91874d9881b9\n"""

8231,"Try to use the user\u0027s default language by default\n\nThe configuration chooser creates an alphabetical list of languages\nand regions. When you open a layout the first time it will just pick\nthe first item in the drop box - the earliest language in the\nalphabet. This is often (usually?) not the native language of the\nuser who probably wants to see either their own locale\u0027s language or\nthe fallback/\Other\"" language.\n\nThis changeset tries to initially pick the user\u0027s language when you\nopen a new layout. It does this by looking up the current locale. I at\nfirst attempted to select the right combobox index but ran into\nproblems because the configuration matcher would later reset it to the\nfirst alphabetically matching language.\n\nInstead this changeset looks up the current locale then finds the\nbest match among the available languages and regions and then adds\nthis language item at the TOP of the language combobox list. This\nmeans it gets picked by the existing default code and it\u0027s also a\nreasonable thing to show first.\n\nChange-Id: Ieb2615fe88520b2901722911b40576f193b58cdb\n"""

This is a more common convention in other GUI\n   builders and you typically don\u0027t want the actual label to be\n   \""@+id\""-something you want it to be \""@string\""-something so the @id\n   prefix is slightly confusing for beginners.\n\n2.

Thus the pipeline is setup\nas follows:\n Sensor -\u003e CSI2 Rcvr -\u003e CCDC -\u003e Preview -\u003e Temp Mem -\u003e Resizer -\u003e Mem\n\nThis means for every pixel there will be three L3 operations:\n 1) Preview write to Temp Mem\n 2) Resizer read from Temp Mem\n 3) Resizer write to final Mem\n\nThis then multiplies the thru-put by 3.\nSo the practical tput is:\n  118387 x 3 \u003d 355161 KB/s\n\nThis constraint successfully holds the Vdd2 to OPP3.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dominic Curran \u003cdcurran@ti.com\u003e\n

8457,cpufreq: interactive: New \u0027interactive\u0027 governor\n\nThis governor is designed for latency-sensitive workloads such as\ninteractive user interfaces.  The interactive governor aims to be\nsignificantly more responsive to ramp CPU quickly up when CPU-intensive\nactivity begins.\n\nExisting governors sample CPU load at a particular rate typically\nevery X ms.  This can lead to under-powering UI threads for the period of\ntime during which the user begins interacting with a previously-idle system\nuntil the next sample period happens.\n\nThe \u0027interactive\u0027 governor uses a different approach. Instead of sampling\nthe CPU at a specified rate the governor will check whether to scale the\nCPU frequency up soon after coming out of idle.  When the CPU comes out of\nidle a timer is configured to fire within 1-2 ticks.  If the CPU is very\nbusy from exiting idle to when the timer fires then we assume the CPU is\nunderpowered and ramp to MAX speed.\n\nIf the CPU was not sufficiently busy to immediately ramp to MAX speed then\nthe governor evaluates the CPU load since the last speed adjustment\nchoosing the highest value between that longer-term load or the short-term\nload since idle exit to determine the CPU speed to ramp to.\n\nA realtime thread is used for scaling up giving the remaining tasks the\nCPU performance benefit unlike existing governors which are more likely to\nschedule rampup work to occur after your performance starved tasks have\ncompleted.\n\nThe tuneables for this governor are:\n/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/interactive/min_sample_time:\n\tThe minimum amount of time to spend at the current frequency before\n\tramping down. This is to ensure that the governor has seen enough\n\thistoric CPU load data to determine the appropriate workload.\n\tDefault is 80000 uS.\n/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/interactive/go_maxspeed_load\n\tThe CPU load at which to ramp to max speed.

If the project contains aapt errors (which means aapt did not run\n   successfully) AND the rendering failed with an error related to\n   resource lookup then begin the render error message with an\n   explanation in bold that this project contains resource errors that\n   could explain the below rendering errors and to investigate those\n   resource errors first.\n\n2. If the project contains javac errors AND the rendering failed\n   after the custom project class loader has been consulted then\n   display a message stating that compilation errors could have\n   caused the failure and to investigate those errors first.\n\n3. If a custom view is loaded and it does not provide a 2- or 3-\n   argument constructor (which takes an AttributeSet) emit a warning\n   that XML attributes on the view will not work.\n\nIn addition this changeset cleans up a few other related things:\n\n- Tags are no longer displayed as part of the error message; these are\n  intended for internal checking only (for example to identify\n  resource errors from other errors)\n\n- The error display text can now show a vertical scrollbar if the text\n  is longer than the available space.\n\n- The code which marks the project class loader as used is marked used\n  as soon as it\u0027s asked to resolve a class name rather than at the\n  completion of a successful load since we want to know about failing\n  custom classes as well.\n\nChange-Id: Ib37a329eed44719ecf741b96ff96747ec4f92ad0\n

8592,Add simple hello-native example.\n\nCopy hello-jni into hello-native and remove all the Java™ parts\nmaking it into a native “Hello World�? sample application.\n\nThe process of writing an Android.mk for mksh involves letting\nits Build.sh configure script compile and link a few “scan�?\nprogrammes and for this we need appropriate definitions of\nCC CFLAGS CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS and LIBS.

8593,Fix a possible deadlock in Eclipse/ADT.\n\nThe issue is that sometimes phones will stop responding to shell\ncommands launched through adb.\n\nOne of these commands is executed in DeviceMonitor#queryNewDeviceForInfo\nHowever this is done from a loop that acquires a lock that is used in\nother places including building. This basically renders eclipse\nuseless as Eclipse will refuse to do anything until the build is\nfinished.\n\nThe fix is twofold:\nFirst move the call to queryNewDeviceForInfo outside of the\nsynchronized block.\n\nThis fixes the deadlock issue but this will not fix the problem\nthat the device monitor will still be stuck with a shell command\nthat never returns.\n\nThe second part of the fix is to add a timeout to shell command\nexecution. Additionnaly this patch contains a lot of clean up\nof the adb API in ddmlib especially around exceptions thrown\nduring timeout.\n\nChange-Id: Ice8ef787c825e0e7b535ff0bb939bf6f25e3d7e4\n

Another leak happens\nanytime these functions are called after a change of the network\nsettings.\n\nThe leak is insignificant and hard to notice on typical programs.\nHowever netd tends to create one new thread for each DNS request\nit processes and quickly grows in size after a \u003e 20 hours.\n\nThe same problem is seen in other system processes that tend to\ncreate one thread per request too.\n\nThe leak occured becasue res_ninit() was called twice when creating\na new thread-specific DNS resolver state in _res_get_thread().\n\nThis function could not properly reset an existing thread and was\nleaking a memory block.\n\nThe patch does two things:\n\n- First it fixes res_ninit() to prevent any leakage when resetting\n  the state of a given res_state instance.\n\n- Second it modifies the _res_get_thread() implementation to\n  make it more explicit and avoid calling res_ninit() twice\n  in a row on first-time creation.\n\nFix for Bug 4089945 and Bug 4090857\n\nChange-Id: Icde1d4d1dfb9383efdbf38d0658ba915be77942e\n

8880,"XML code completion improvements\n\nThis changeset contains a number of improvements to the code\ncompletion in XML files.\n\n(1) Add suffix completion in attribute values. For dimensional\n    attributes this will add in (or complete prefixes of) units like\n    \dp\"" \""sp\"" etc. For fractional attributes the % and %p suffixes\n    are completed. (In both cases there is also a tooltip message\n    provided shown in the completion documentation popup).  In\n    addition for flag values when completing at the end of a flag\n    then the separator character (|) along with the other flag values\n    (except those already set) are offered.\n\n(2) Handle completion when the caret is not at the end. For example\n    if you have the following source:\n\n        layout_w^idth\u003d\""wrap_content\""    (^ \u003d caret position)\n\n    then if you invoke code completion you will also be offered the\n    attribute layout_weight and selecting it will -replace- the\n    layout_width attribute with layout_height it will not insert\n    layout_weight in the middle of layout_width. This handling is done\n    not just for attribute names as shown here but for attribute\n    values and element tag names as well.\n\n(3) Improve @resource/ completion sorting. When completing resources\n    consider which attribute is being completed and use that\n    information to sort the resources.  For example if completing a\n    \""text\"" attribute then @string/ and @android:string/ resources\n    will be listed first.  For attributes like margins @dimen will be\n    first for include layout the @layout attributes will be listed\n    first and so on.  Also the resources are sorted alphabetically\n    as the second sort key.\n\n(4) Hide some builtin Eclipse code completion items. In particular\n    the default code completion provider for Eclipse will always add\n    the current attribute value as a completion. This is extremely\n    confusing since if you have a typo code completion will tell you\n    that what you have is okay. I personally witnessed this confusing\n    a user who had typed something from memory and code completion\n    seemed to him to \""confirm\"" that he had it right.\n\n    To fix this the code which installs completion providers will\n    identify the builting WST completion provider and when found\n    replace it with a \""filtering\"" wrapper. This completion provider\n    delegates all its calls to the WST completion provider but it\n    recognizes a few patterns in particular the above attribute value\n    completion proposal as well as some namespace and schema ones and\n    removes these.\n\n    (The reason we only filter out these items instead of removing it\n    completely is that the completion provider also appears to be\n    responsible for inserting code templates defined by the user and\n    we don\u0027t want to neuter those if defined by the user.)\n\n(5) Fix a bunch of corner cases - flags could only have a single\n    separator (|) resource attribute completion items were missing\n    icons and completion in some positions was not working.\n\n(6) Unit tests. There are now comprehensive unit tests for code\n    completion. Each unit test points to a particular source file\n    and a particular position within the source file and code completion\n    is invoked for that position. A set of unit tests dump out the\n    allowed completion items for each such position and these are\n    compared against golden files. A second set of unit tests then\n    specify a particular code completion item among the choices to\n    be applied and then applies that completion item to the document.\n    This along with the caret position (indicated as ^) is written\n    into a golden file and used for comparisons. To make it easy\n    to see what these tests do the golden file is actually recorded\n    as a diff so in the test you will see something like this:\n\nCode completion in completion1.xml for android:gravity\u003d\""left|b^ottom\""\nselecting bottom:\n\u003c         android:gravity\u003d\""left|bottom\""\n---\n\u003e         android:gravity\u003d\""left|bottom^\""\n\n(6) There are some other misc changes. We had some code which used\n    \""dip\"" for device indepdendent pixels (such as the AbsoluteLayout\n    handler). Since \""dp\"" seems to be preferred the code will now\n    use that instead.\n\nChange-Id: I8bd5c8336d8747dac1f10a9269ea4197f304cb70\n"""

8902,Improve hyperlink resolution for configurations\n\nThe hyperlink resolver would only look for values in the base values/\nfolder. This did not work well for resources that are ONLY defined in\nspecific configurations. This changeset improves the search to look in\nall eligible resource folders. It also uses support from the layout\nlibrary to more quickly identify the right files to check.\n\nThe hyperlink resolver now also considers the configuration chooser in\nthe designtab (if opened) and uses this configuration\nfirst. Therefore if you for example have chosen to view a particular\nlanguage hyperlink resolution will jump to the specific translation\nstring rather than the base string as before.\n\nA few other fixes are included:\n\n- Look in the current file for @id references to resolve first (common\n  in a layout where you have @id references to attachments)\n- Fix search for @attr/ attributes\n- Fix bug where attributes inside a custom view class would be ignored\n  and it would jump to the custom class instead\n\nChange-Id: Ia97a3f45bf454cc28378387b219af0fdd855a902\n
8903,Fix for CTS testScreenConfiguration\n\nThe previous implementation of testScreenConfiguration() failed to\npass some acceptable aspect ratios.\nExample: A screen in 16:9 screen ratio that is 480 pixels wide\nwould have to be 853333 pixels high to be exactly 16:9. This is\nof course not possible so we must allow both 853 and 854 pixels\nin this example. The previous implementation would only accept\n853.\n\nChange-Id: Ic5e7fa523869d1036821bb29c602ee82ec750238\n

If you for example\nhave this code in your Activity:\n\n\tsetContentView(R.layout.main);\n\nand you control click on \main\"" this will now offer (in addition to\nthe normal \""Declaration\"" hyperlink) go to \""XML Declaration\"") which\nwill then warp to the main.xml file.\n\nYou can add in the second modifier key to directly jump to the Android\nresource and bypass the normal Java declaration (which would take you\ninto the R file). The Android Java hyperlink works from R file field\ndeclarations too by the way.\n\nThis now also works for id attributes defined inline so if you for\nexample jump to R.id.Button01 and this will open the first\n@+id/Button01 element found in the layout directory.\n\nYou can also open non-XML references such as @drawable/icon. This\nwill run the Eclipse open command on the icon.\n\nThe processing of XML regions is improved so it will now only\nhighlight say the value part of an XML attribute or the name part or\nthe element tag name part.\n\nFinally the hyperlink resolvers can now jump into @android resource\nfiles (as found in the SDK data directory). Thus you can warp into\n(say) @android:drawable/alert_dark_frame.\n\nChange-Id: I83fcd1ffb08590f7f587b90f5c64784fe8ce5f67\n"""

The dumpsys process queries service manager\nto get a reference to meminfo service and invoke dump() on the same.\nThe meminfo service is created by ActivityManagerService\u0027s\nsetSystemProcess(). The dump() method tries to acquire a lock on\nActivityManagerService which is held by ActivityManagerService\u0027s\nservice/broadcasttimeout (awaiting the response from\nActivityController for the second ANR).\n\nThis cyclic deadlock continues for a minute after which WatchDog\nthread of system_server kills system_server as it hasn\u0027t got the\nresponse from ActivityManagerService\u0027s monitor().

9084,Fix problem with Intent being found as hidden\n\nOn some builds (even with identical source trees) the build\ncould fail reporting that Intent was a hidden type.  However\nIntent is not hidden and the error was wrong.\n\nThe problem lies in the Java system somewhere in that the\nindexOf method was returning an index beyond the end of the\nstring.  The resolution here is simply to copy the string to\na new string and search that.  This resolution proved to be\nstable and reliable on gingerbread and while it occurs much\nless frequently on ice cream sandwich it has still been\nspotted a few times.\n\nChange-Id: Iea620680d688635645f4ce3e67ba28ff4ec53314\n

9145,Various layout fixes\n\nFirst fix absolute layout such that it properly handles both screen\nscaling as well as various screen resolution densities when it\ncomputes the dip positions.\n\nSecond pass the bounds surrounding the mouse position when a drag is\ninitiated to the view rules. This is used by both absolute layout and\nrelative layout to properly handle dragging bounds. In particular in\nrelative layout this is used to match a border not only when the mouse\ncursor gets near the edge but when the bound edges also get near the\nedge. In absolute layout this is used to show a correct bound\nrectangle that has the proper offset from the original drag position\n(which may not be the center which until now it was assuming).\n\nThird in RelativeLayout when there are no children offer a left\nalignment regardless of where you are within the rectangle. This is\nsimilar to how LinearLayout works.\n\nIn addition two internal changes:\n* Factor the various RelativeLayout string constants into the\n  LayoutConstants class.

I must admit I\u0027d never in my life seen code\nthat loaded upper case letters into a string and then went back and looped\nover that string to run tolower() on it!!! I mean why not just load in the\nlowercase values instead??? I shudder to think how much CO2 has been released\ninto the atmosphere just over that bit of coding.\n\nAnd of course since I was doing something silly and knew you the reviewer would\ndefinitely think I was doing something silly I also wrote some test code to\nmake sure I hadn\u0027t written a broken replacement for code that was somewhat\nsilly to me but was otherwise functional.\n\nThere is one difference between my replacement code and the original. The\noriginal code would use the T macro to check at each individual portion of the\nstring as it built it. So if it were trying to build 10w10d and ran out of room\nin the destination buffer after 10w you would get 10w in the destination buffer.\n\nMy code builds the whole string and then checks that there is room for it in\nthe destination buffer. I checked the callers and when -1 is returned for\ninsufficient buffer space they all give up anyway e.g. no one used the partial\nstring value for some bizzare purpose.\n\nMy eye also glanced down to ns_parse_ttl and I found a few things that begged\nme to tweak them as well. I couldn\u0027t see any purpose to the usascii and\nprintable checks. All values are 100% handled without those checks. I also\ncouldn\u0027t see why one needed to force lowercase when all one had to do was add\nthe lowercase values to the perfectly good switch statement already present.\n\nThere are other issues with that parser that called to me to fix them but I\nfigured I was already pushing my luck with you the reviewer to get you to\napprove this much of a re-write over a confused compiler. :-)\n\nHere is the test code I wrote for ns_format_ttl:\n\nint main( int argc const char* argv[] )\n{\n  char buf[1024];\n  buf[0] \u003d -1;\n  buf[1] \u003d -1;\n  buf[2] \u003d -1;\n  int res \u003d ns_format_ttl(0 \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl(60 \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl((60 * 60) \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl((60 * 60) * 24 \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl(((60 * 60) * 24) * 7 \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl(((((60 * 60) * 24) * 7) * 1000) - 1 \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl(((((60 * 60) * 24) * 7) * 100) - 1 \u0026buf[0] 10);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl(((((60 * 60) * 24) * 7) * 100) - 1 \u0026buf[0] 14);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl(((((60 * 60) * 24) * 7) * 100) - 1 \u0026buf[0] 15);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl((((60 * 60) * 24) * 7) * 1000 \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl( - 1 \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n  res \u003d ns_format_ttl( - 1000000 \u0026buf[0] 1024);\n  printf( \""res: %d buf: %s\\n\"" res \u0026buf[0]);\n}\n\nAs you can see I checked to make sure the trailing 0 was getting into the\ndestination buffer by preloading the buffer with -1\u0027s for the first test.\n\nI believe I have 100% code coverage and also made sure to check the corner cases\non rejecting buffer size including the case of the trailing 0 being properly rejected as well.\n\nAnd I checked the worst case extremes of feeding in 0 and -1. I also figured\nout a value to feed in that would produce a maximum length string to make\nsure I had properly sized the temporary buffer.\n\nResults from the test:\n\nres: 2 buf: 0s\nres: 2 buf: 1m\nres: 2 buf: 1h\nres: 2 buf: 1d\nres: 2 buf: 1w\nres: 15 buf: 999w6d23h59m59s\nres: -1 buf: 999w6d23h59m59s\nres: -1 buf: 999w6d23h59m59s\nres: 14 buf: 99w6d23h59m59s\nres: 5 buf: 1000w\nres: 16 buf: 2006136047w7h15s\nres: 22 buf: 2006136045w2d17h13m36s\n\nHopefully you will note that while the compiler was confused with the original\ncode it really did deserve a re-write. This new code may not shave seconds\noff the boot time but it will reduce stack size and save some CPU cycles.\n\nThank you for your time.\n"""

9258,Fix the event interrupt in IOAPIC model\n\nAfter switching to IOAPIC model the goldfish event device is broken\nand no input can be sent to emulator.\n\nThe reason is when system initializing IOAPIC the event device\u0027s interrupt\nis enabled by kernel core code because it\u0027s edege interrupt.\nWhen goldfish event driver is enabled the interrupt is injected right\nafter events_probe() begin events read to some specific register and\nbefore request_irq(). Because the request_irq() is not called the kernel\nassume the interrupt is spurious interrupt and will masked it out\nand the interrupt will never be injected.\n\nCurrently there is already a HACK in goldfish event device emulation which\ninject interrupt to driver after input device is initiate. With IOAPIC\nsupport we have to postpone the injection to after request_irq(). This postpone\nshould be ok because it\u0027s that time we can say driver is fully ready.\n\nThis requires corresponding kernel changes and the patch is set so that it still\nhas backward compatibility. For original driver it will inject first interrupt as\nbefore while for new driver it injected only after ack from driver that is ready.\n\nChange-Id: I133179a082c4b0d3760a511d721d77a586d28506\nSigned-off-by: Jiang Yunhong \u003cyjiang5@intel.com\u003e\n

Also when the variable LOCAL_JNI_SHARED_LIBRARIES\nis defined the JNI library will be included in the APK.\nBut this is another redundant when the application is built\nwith the framework.\n\nTo resolve the issue we apply following policies\n1. Check the LOCAL_REQUIRED_MODULES and put it in the\n   ALL_MODULES.$(LOCAL_MODULE).REQUIRED\n2.

The APIC\ndevice model is in the emulator already but only support \u003c 16 IRQ number\nbecause all interrupt is passed from PIC to IOAPIC.\n\nAdding a logic in PIC so that if the IRQ number \u003e\u003d 16it is passed to\nIOAPIC directly. This changes requires several changes in other components.\nFirstly the pc bios. Currently the pc bios present MP table to cover\nonly 16 interrupt increase it to be 48 also. Secondly the kernel is\nupdated to utilize Uni-Processor APIC model.\n\nAlso change the IOAPIC pin number from 24 to 48 so that it\u0027s enough in\nexpected range.\n\nChange-Id: I829e20feffe771edb6d915845db695cbbf2c54bb\nSigned-off-by: Jiang Yunhong \u003cyunhong.jiang@intel.com\u003e\n

9265,"Fixed disappearing menu options when switching from landscape to portrait.\n\nThe email client had menu options that appeared to disappear when one menu\nitem was pressed while the phone was rotated between landscape and portrait\nmode.  Menu options and text were actually already there but they were\nusing white text.\n\nThe issue is that the alert dialog used by the email client was using recycled\nviews when the phone was rotated.  One TextView had the \pressed\"" flag set\nwhen it went into the recycle bin.  That TextView was then pulled out of the\nrecycle bin as a different menu option so the TextView that was \""Open\"" in\nlandscape became \""Save\"" in portrait.  Then the text option that was previously\nset then had its flag cleared.  Since that option was not the one with the pressed\nflag set because of the recycle change the option that was not selected continued\nto print its text as if its pressed flag was set.  This made option that was using\nwhite text change between portrait and landscape mode.\n\nThe fix was to clear the focus selected and pressed flags when a view is pulled\nfrom the recycle bin to be reused.  The focus selected and pressed flags are\nall properties that are manipulated by the ListView and its parents (AbsListView\nAdapterView and ViewGroup).  The RecycleBin class is an inner class in AbsListView\nand is only used by its children.\n\nChange-Id: Ib966df28f976e0cf3a77d3865044e7457026c456\n"""

It\u0027s not possible to generate\n  more than one APK in a single pass. The export project will\n  handle this and call out the normal build system to export\n  each variant. Make older (deprecated) attribute actually\n  output a warning.\n\n- Ant rules r3 now with support for multi apk export. Lots\n  of clean up add new properties to be overriden by the\n  multi-apk export task make older one overrideable too.\n\n- Better handling of older rules older tasks etc...\n  in the SetupTask used by the normal build.\n\n- Add split by ABI to ApkSettings and use it in the\n  new multi apk export.\n\n- New custom task for multi-apk export. Replaces\n  SetupTask for export-type projects. Calls out to the\n  project\u0027s build.xml after setting/overriding properties.\n  This also override the project\u0027s versionCode with a\n  new composite one made of different values.\n  Also uses a different build.xml so added a new template:\n  build.export.template.\n\nVery much a work in progress.

This should leave a page allocated when the\nbinder is released.  When binder_deferrred_release is called on the\nclose the page will remain mapped to the address in the linear\nproc-\u003ebuffer.

9420,Fix for a crash when GC weak references.\n\nWhen a weak reference had been cleared there was a small risk that\nthe VM crashed when the cleared reference was garbage collected.\n\nThis is an example of code that can cause the problem:\n   Integer referent \u003d new Integer(10);\n   wref \u003d new WeakReference\u003cInteger\u003e(referent);\n   wref.clear(); //set the referent to null\n\nWhen a garbage collection starts all objects are scanned looking\nfor objects that can be collected. During this phase a list of\nweak references is created. A check is performed to ensure that\nonly references with a non-null referent are added to this list.\nIn most cases for the example above the referent will be null\nat this point and it will never be added to the list. But if\nthe timing is extremely bad it looks like it is possible for the\nreference to end up on the list before the referent has been set\nto null and the referent is set to null a little while later.\nThis means that we now have a reference on the list with a null\nreferent.\n\nA bit later in the garbage collection flow the list of weak\nreferences is traversed in order to clear the references that\ncan be collected. Here we got the crash because the code asserted\nthat the referent of the references in the list should be\nnon-null. And in some rare cases it actually was null. The fix\nis simply to remove the assert.\n\nChange-Id: I722b51008f3d6f69abd13490663bef8010c96847\n

9538,msm: clock: Replace clock handles with real clocks\n\nDynamically generating clocks at runtime doesn\u0027t work well with\nclkdev. Currently handles are generated whenever clk_get() is\ncalled on a SHARED clock. Instead of doing that add the handful\nof clocks voting on ebi1 as new clocks. Make the clocks act the\nsame as the handles but don\u0027t dynamically allocate them at\nruntime. This allows us to migrate to clkdev while maintaining\nthe ebi1 rate voting via the clk API.\n\nChange-Id: I84002ead0e8fffae26c5067112a80a53538490d6\nSigned-off-by: Stephen Boyd \u003csboyd@codeaurora.org\u003e\n
9539,msm: clock: Implement rate voting\n\nSome clocks have multiple consumers where each consumer requires\na minimum rate.

However\nthe bounds were a bit too big because we were using the raw size of\nthe drag image and it now includes a drop shadow!  This changeset\nadjusts this such that we use the original ViewInfo bounds from the\nrender rather than the usually larger image bounds.\n\nChange-Id: Ic4b870995e17284fbd8a7ed2f4b4a7ec02f4e2c3\n

Turns out it\u0027s not\nintermittent at all: Our keybinding registration was wrong which\nmeant that only the last opened editor would actually work; the global\nactions would ALWAYS map to that one editor. I discovered this when I\nhappened to have two editors side by side!\n\nThe global action registration mechanism we were using assumes that\neach view has its own IActionBar. That\u0027s generally true but NOT for\neditors! That means we have to re-register the action bindings\nourselves when the active editor changes. To do that we register our\nown IEditorActionBarContributor which will notify us when the actions\nneed to be updated for editor activation.\n\nChange-Id: Ia49246a1f0fd14a717efe591b04b1b6529b23922\n

If there\u0027s enough of these anonymous pages\n(e.g. due to heavy use of tmpfs) the lowmemorykiller may never\nkill any processes at all.\n\nInstead use NR_ACTIVE_FILE + NR_INACTIVE_FILE for systems without\nany swap available.

9828,"Remove lock from OpenSSLSessionImpl finalizer to fix a deadlock\n\nIn commit f68a91f63595904de706fe068c8c5f336d61dc85 code that “touches native SSL Sessions�? in OpenSSLSocketImpl.java were\nmade synchronized by locking the OpenSSLSocketImpl class. Unfortunately the same lock was used for instance counting which\nlead to situations where the native calls could end up blocking the garbage collector. That was fixed in commit\nf681a0fc7db58aeead2d6970a717d8a466c1b516.\nBut it looks like we have run into a similar situation as in the latter case above again. In the former commit above a\nsynchronization block was added to OpenSSLSessionImpl#finalize as well. So what we see now is a crash where the garbage\ncollector is blocked from finalizing an OpenSSLSessionImpl object because of a native call in OpenSSLSocketImpl. Please see\nthe crash stack below.\nThe solution we see is to remove the unnecessary synchronized block in OpenSSLSessionImpl#finalize.\nRemoving the synchronization block is safe as in the cases where the OpenSSLSocketImpl needs to touch the sessionId it holds\na reference to a living OpenSSLSessionImpl object. The OpenSSLSessionImpl object cannot be collected as it lives and\ntherefore the synchronization on the OpenSSLSessionImpl.class is not needed.\n\n01-14 03:40:37.288 I/dalvikvm(16601): \Thread-9\"" prio\u003d5 tid\u003d17 NATIVE\n01-14 03:40:37.288 I/dalvikvm(16601):   | group\u003d\""main\"" sCount\u003d1 dsCount\u003d0 s\u003dN obj\u003d0x2e5b5f00 self\u003d0x178438\n01-14 03:40:37.288 I/dalvikvm(16601):   | sysTid\u003d16608 nice\u003d10 sched\u003d0/0 handle\u003d1541464\n01-14 03:40:37.288 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at org.apache.harmony.xnet.provider.jsse.OpenSSLSocketImpl.nativeconnect(Native\nMethod)\n01-14 03:40:37.288 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at\norg.apache.harmony.xnet.provider.jsse.OpenSSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:305)\n01-14 03:40:37.288 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at\norg.apache.harmony.xnet.provider.jsse.OpenSSLSocketImpl$SSLInputStream.\u003cinit\u003e(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:502)\n01-14 03:40:37.288 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at\norg.apache.harmony.xnet.provider.jsse.OpenSSLSocketImpl.getInputStream(OpenSSLSocketImpl.java:443)\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at com.android.email.mail.transport.MailTransport.open(MailTransport.java:161)\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at com.android.email.mail.transport.SmtpSender.open(SmtpSender.java:128)\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at com.android.email.mail.transport.SmtpSender.sendMessage(SmtpSender.java:207)\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at\ncom.android.email.MessagingController.sendPendingMessagesSynchronous(MessagingController.java:1751)\n\n...\n\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601): \""HeapWorker\"" daemon prio\u003d5 tid\u003d5 MONITOR\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601):   | group\u003d\""system\"" sCount\u003d1 dsCount\u003d0 s\u003dN obj\u003d0x2d7e8e60 self\u003d0x155268\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601):   | sysTid\u003d16602 nice\u003d0 sched\u003d0/0 handle\u003d1132792\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at\norg.apache.harmony.xnet.provider.jsse.OpenSSLSessionImpl.finalize(OpenSSLSessionImpl.java:-1)\n01-14 03:40:37.298 I/dalvikvm(16601):   at dalvik.system.NativeStart.run(Native Method)\n"""

However this view does not incorporate the other logging\nerrors such as resource failures.\n\nThis changeset combines the output so that you see everything --\nmissing and broken classes resource warnings and any other rendering\nproblems.\n\nIt also makes the hyperlinks pointing to classes in the error output\n*open* the class if it already exists and if not continue to open\nthe New Class wizard as before.\n\nChange-Id: Ic79282b8f502f03f587028040150e2cca3395fd9\n
9914,ARM: tegra: dma: Do not call complete callback on canceled requests\n\nCalling the complete callback when a request is cancelled leads to\nlocking problems in the callback which could be called from an IRQ\nwith no locks held or from whatever context called\ntegra_dma_dequeue_req.  Instead expect the caller to handle the\nnow-cancelled request as needed.\n\nAlso removes tegra_dma_dequeue since all users can be trivially\nconverted to tegra_dma_dequeue_req.\n\nChange-Id: If699239c09c78d1cd3afa0eaad46535b1d401a24\nSigned-off-by: Colin Cross \u003cccross@android.com\u003e\n
9915,Reset the ProjectCallback when the rendering target changes.\n\nThis is only done if the layout has custom views.

Otherwise callbacks\nwill be generated on programming (when settings get into the\nDISPC) when the settings are displayed and on eclipse (when settings\nare overwritten by newer settings).  Depending on the stage where the\neclipse happens a different callback is generated.\n\nStatus is one of the DSS_COMPLETION_... enum values specifying the event.\n\nDSS_COMPLETION_ECLIPSED_SET - info was overwritten at stage 1\nDSS_COMPLETION_ECLIPSED_CACHE - info was overwritten at stage 2\nDSS_COMPLETION_ECLIPSED_SHADOW - info was overwritten at stage 3\nDSS_COMPLETION_RELEASED - info was overwritten at stage 4 (after successfully\nbeing displayed)\nDSS_COMPLETION_TORN - info was overwritten at stage 4 (before it was\nsuccessfully displayed)\n\nDSS_COMPLETION_PROGRAMMED - info moved from stage 3 to stage 4 (this follows\nthe prior info\u0027s callback of DSS_COMPLETION_RELEASED/TORN)\n\nDSS_COMPLETION_DISPLAYED - info in stage 4 has been successfully displayed.\nThis callback is received on every frame refresh.  If only the first display\nis required it needs to be filtered out in the callback.\n\nYou can use the DSS_COMPLETION_RELEASED flag to see if an info has been\neclipsed (so you don\u0027t have to check for all 5 values).\n\nThere is a fundamental issue with tracking DSS settings in the current\nDSS2 framework.  Pipeline/manager settings are programmed first into\nan info structure that stays around.  These settins can be modified\npiece-by-piece - as they are done using the sysfs framework.  Theoretically\nthese cause the old settings to be eclipsed by the new settings.  However\nsysfs interface is used to augment the other DSS2 users that would register\nfor these callbacks.  Therefore we need to treat these partial updates\nspecially.  For now - if the callback function and data are the same -\na different status is used: DSS_COMPLETION_CHANGED_SET.\n\nNow these auxiliary interfaces also apply the changes automatically so a\nsimilar method needs to be used at level 2.  (DSS_COMPLETION_CHANGED_CACHE)\nThis however causes callback info to stay around at the level 1\ninterface making it not useful for tracking the status.  We cannot\nguarantee that the information is tracked from setting to release/eclipse\nif future settings may end up reusing (ignorantly) the same callback info.\n\nFor now the callback info is cleared at level 1 when transferred to\nlevel 2.  If other - callback unaware - DSS2 users modify overlay/manager\nsettings (e.g. using sysfs controls in any way) they will not reset\nthe callback.  We err on the side of sysfs and we will not treat a\nsettings application (transferring level 1 info to level 2) as eclipsed\nif the level-1 callback method is empty.  This works for sysfs changes\nbut we will be a missed callback if V4L2 or FB is changing the base\naddress and we are using the callbacks to track buffer usage.\n\nThe other issue is using sysfs to enable/disable an overlay.  We may\nget a RELEASED event on disable but no usage callback is done on\nsubsequent enable because sysfs will not request a callback.\n\nChange-Id: I0b7fdbeefe71e40dc86ec8401dbc7e82374eaeb5\nSigned-off-by: Lajos Molnar \u003cmolnar@ti.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Mark Tyler \u003cmark.tyler@ti.com\u003e\n\nOMAP:DSS:DSSCOMP: New composition module\n\nThis patch implements a new DSS composition module.\n\nDSSCOMP allows specifying a whole composition for a DSS display:\n\n    1. set overlay information for all overlays on a manager\n    2. reroute the overlays to the manager (overlay must be disabled\n       just as when using sysfs)\n    3. set manager information\n    4. optionally call manager-\u003eapply() that programs the DISPC\n    4. optionally do an update (after a sync call)\n\n    DSS already implements coordinated updates by separating overlay\n    information setting from the applicaion of those settings (which\n    happens only in manager-\u003eapply()).  However current users of DSS\n    call manager-\u003eapply() for each change which make coordinated\n    change impossible.\n\n    This API also implements auto cropping of all layers to the display\n    region.  This makes switching displays and handling display resolution\n    changes easier (without getting \failed to setup overlay\"" messages.)\n\nDSSCOMP operates on 3 levels.\n\nbase.c contains the basic DSS operations such as setting DSS overlay\nand managers using DSSCOMP\u0027s setting structures.  Theoretically\nDSSCOMP could be used via only these operations.\n\nqueue.c contains the queuing mechanism.  This module maintains\ncompositions queued to each overlay manager (the basic DSS composition\nentity).  Each composition is referred to by a unique sync-id.\nQueueing operations consist of creating a composition setting/getting\nmanager/overlay information for the composition applying the\ncomposition to the display (which also displays it on manually\nupdated panels) waiting on various states of a composition.\n\nFor now the basic queuing mechanism of DSSCOMP is \""queue and forget\"".\nTherefore it is not necessary to dequeue each frame queued.  A\nconsequence of this methodology is that if one applies a composition\nto a display any prior unapplied compositions will be dropped.\n\nThe queuing interface tracks which overlay is assigned to which\nmanager.  This is done at the DSS programming level as that is the\nmost reliable place to monitor overlay ownership.  Nonetheless\nthe device interface uses overlay information to verify overlay\nownership - which may be slightly out of sync.  The user of\nDSSCOMP should maintain overlay ownership to ensure flawless\nsharing of overlays between managers.  (E.g. should not use an\noverlay on a new manager until the overlay has been disabled on\nthe previous manager and that composition has been programmed.)\n\ndevice.c contains the device hooks to operating system and the file\ninterface (via /dev/dsscomp\u0027s ioctls).  /dev/dsscomp works on top of\nthe queueing mechanism.\n\nThere are 3 levels of header files.\n\nlinux/dsscomp.h: basic dsscomp structures and ioctls\nplat/dsscomp.h: kernel dsscomp interface (on top of linux/dsscomp.h)\nlocal dsscomp.h: common implementation structures and shared methods\n\nNote: plat/dsscomp.h defines a handle typedef that causes a\ncheckpatch warning.  I feel that the creation of a handle typedef\nis warranted.\n\nLimitations:\n- no WB support\n- unsure whether to call sync on non-manual update panels\n- cannot get overlay/manager information on a composition without\nfirst having set it\n- not fully operational - still debugging some unit test issues\n\nChange-Id: I5826a409f4fd258c8ce86e782c5e6bdd4bf9bcf4\nSigned-off-by: Lajos Molnar \u003cmolnar@ti.com\u003e\n\nOMAP:DSS:DSSCOMP: Add DSS composition module to build/config system\n\nThis patch links in the DSS composition (dsscomp) module into the\nbuild and configuration system.

10068,Fix various bugs related to linear layout handling\n\nThis changeset fixes the following issues with LinearLayout:\n\n* Correctly position the last insert position in the linear layout\n  when the layout has children.\n\n* When you drag a widget which is already in this LinearLayout don\u0027t\n  show insert positions before and after this element and show a\n  match position exactly where it already is.\n\n* Show the best-matching lines not only when you don\u0027t have bounds\n  (which it was already doing) but also in conjunction with the bounds\n  outlines. When the dragged bounds are much larger than the widgets\n  around the drop position it was a bit hard to figure out where\n  exactly the proposed drop position is and this change makes it a\n  lot clearer.\n\n* Fix positioning of the drop rectangle. Before this change we were\n  positioning the drop rectangle using its existing deltaXdeltaY in\n  its old parent; this does not work well both in multi-document cases\n  as well as cases where you are dragging from one layout to\n  another. We are now simply positioning it at delta\u003d0 in the new\n  layout; the next enhancement here would be to consider the\n  layoutGravity.\n\nChange-Id: I1c71c3c48a4c104a5cde7382fb1f9a21e57122bc\n

10075,Add basic suspend/resume support for networking.\n\nThis patch saves the current state of the SMSC 91C111 ethernet\nemulation. The restore function will restore all buffers thus\npreventing segfaults when guest code tries to access data that was\nthere when state was saved. However no effort is made to\nre-establish connections. This is probably impossible anyway since\nwe have no way to generically make the remote end pick up where we\nleft when state was suspended.\n\nFrom the perspective of the guest resuming is therefore equivalent\nto a temporary network failure in which all open connections are\nlost. After the restore is complete new connections can be made\nas though nothing happened.\n\nChange-Id: Ibbbabc685ef296e675d4018996f703e07d9aad6a\n

When a device\nconfiguration change occurs or a device is removed the endpoints for\nthe old config should be completely disabled.  However it turns out\nthey aren\u0027t; this is because usb_unbind_interface() calls\nusb_enable_interface() or usb_set_interface() to put interfaces back\nin altsetting 0 which re-enables the interfaces\u0027 endpoints.\n\nAs a result when a device goes through a config change or is\nunconfigured the ep_in[] and ep_out[] arrays may be left holding old\npointers to usb_host_endpoint structures.  If the device is\ndeauthorized these structures get freed and the stale pointers cause\nerrors when the the device is eventually unplugged.\n\nThe solution is to disable the endpoints after unbinding the\ninterfaces instead of before.  This isn\u0027t as large a change as it\nsounds since usb_unbind_interface() disables all the interface\u0027s\nendpoints anyway before calling the driver\u0027s disconnect routine\nunless the driver claims to support \soft\"" unbind.\n\nThis fixes Bugzilla #19192.

10197,mm x86: Saving vmcore with non-lazy freeing of vmas\n\ncommit 3ee48b6af49cf534ca2f481ecc484b156a41451d upstream.\n\nDuring the reading of /proc/vmcore the kernel is doing\nioremap()/iounmap() repeatedly. And the buildup of un-flushed\nvm_area_struct\u0027s is causing a great deal of overhead. (rb_next()\nis chewing up most of that time).\n\nThis solution is to provide function set_iounmap_nonlazy(). It\ncauses a subsequent call to iounmap() to immediately purge the\nvma area (with try_purge_vmap_area_lazy()).\n\nWith this patch we have seen the time for writing a 250MB\ncompressed dump drop from 71 seconds to 44 seconds.\n\nSigned-off-by: Cliff Wickman \u003ccpw@sgi.com\u003e\nCc: Andrew Morton \u003cakpm@linux-foundation.org\u003e\nCc: kexec@lists.infradead.org\nLKML-Reference: \u003cE1OwHZ4-0005WK-Tw@eag09.americas.sgi.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Ingo Molnar \u003cmingo@elte.hu\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

10200,Fixing Android Source attachements\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n- add Android Source code to android.jar (you can install Android\n  Sources plugin from http://code.google.com/p/adt-addons/)\n- ensure that android.app.ActivityThread exists in the source\n  attachement (if you use Sources plugin it exists)\n- create an Android application and add the next code to\n  onCreate method:\n\tsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        Object obj \u003d null;\n        System.out.println(obj.toString());\n        setContentView(R.layout.main);\n- set breakpoint at line\n  System.out.println(obj.toString()); (NPE)\n- debug the application\n- wait that apps stop on breakpoint\n- click Step Over\n\nThe procces will proceed in ActivityThread but source is not shown.\n\nThe problem happens because the Android source locator introduced in\nhttps://review.source.android.com/#change16569 isn\u0027t correct.\nActivityThread.java isn\u0027t included to android.jar but can be\nincluded in the source attachement.

10202,Test infrastructure fixes\n\nAdd methods which allow a test case to specify that it needs a unique\nproject for the testcase (or even for each individual test\nmethod). This allows tests which modify the project (such as the\nquickfix-resource-creation tests) to not cause side effects that\naffect other tests (e.g. resources created by the quickfix could show\nup in code completion results by the code completion tests which\nmeant the goldenfiles would have to either include them or exclude\nthem which meant the tests must always be run together or never run\ntogether.\n\nThe changeset also adds an environment variable pointing to the git\nworking copy allowing tests with no golden file to create the golden\nfiles directly. This makes it easy to add new test cases; just write\nthe test scenarios run them which will fail all the tests but also\nwrite out the expected golden files. Verify them and check them in and\nrunning the tests again should pass if the output is stable.\n\nChange-Id: I2e2789c00c84a31a9fbc603851879d8d83342ad3\n

10209,x86 intr-remap: Set redirection hint in the IRTE\n\ncommit 75e3cfbed6f71a8f151dc6e413b6ce3c390030cb upstream.\n\nCurrently the redirection hint in the interrupt-remapping table entry\nis set to 0 which means the remapped interrupt is directed to the\nprocessors listed in the destination. So in logical flat mode\nin the presence of intr-remapping this results in a single\ninterrupt multi-casted to multiple cpu\u0027s as specified by the destination\nbit mask. But what we really want is to send that interrupt to one of the cpus\nbased on the lowest priority delivery mode.\n\nSet the redirection hint in the IRTE to \u00271\u0027 to indicate that we want\nthe remapped interrupt to be directed to only one of the processors\nlisted in the destination.\n\nThis fixes the issue of same interrupt getting delivered to multiple cpu\u0027s\nin the logical flat mode in the presence of interrupt-remapping. While\nthere is no functional issue observed with this behavior this will\nimpact performance of such configurations (\u003c\u003d8 cpu\u0027s using logical flat\nmode in the presence of interrupt-remapping)\n\nSigned-off-by: Suresh Siddha \u003csuresh.b.siddha@intel.com\u003e\nLKML-Reference: \u003c20100827181049.013051492@sbsiddha-MOBL3.sc.intel.com\u003e\nCc: Weidong Han \u003cweidong.han@intel.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: H.

Reenable preemption before calling handle_vm86_trap(). This\nwas the approach that was later reverted.\n\n2. Do not disable preemption for i386 in breakpoint and debug handlers.\nThis was the situation before October 2008. As far as I understand\npreemption only needs to be disabled on x86_64 because a seperate stack is\nused but it\u0027s nice to have things work the same way on\ni386 and x86_64.\n\n3. Let handle_vm86_trap() return instead of jumping to assembly code.\nBy setting a flag in _TIF_WORK_MASK either TIF_IRET or TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME\nthe code in entry_32.S is instructed to return to 32 bit mode from\nV86 mode. The logic in entry_32.S was already present to handle signals.\n(I chose TIF_IRET because it\u0027s slightly more efficient in\ndo_notify_resume() in signal.c but in fact TIF_IRET can probably be\nreplaced by TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME everywhere.)\n\nI\u0027m submitting approach 3 because I believe it is the most elegant\nand prevents future confusion. Still an obvious\npreempt_conditional_cli(regs); is necessary in traps.c to correct the\nbug.\n\n[ hpa: This is technically a regression but because:\n  1. the regression is so old\n  2. the patch seems relatively high risk justifying more testing and\n  3. we\u0027re late in the 2.6.36-rc cycle\n\n  I\u0027m queuing it up for the 2.6.37 merge window.

It has the tab key\nnext to space to move between input fields in a web form. There are\ntwo variants of that layout -- with and without \""settings\"" key.\n\nThe variant with settings key (a default one) is fine: space bar\nis almost as wide as in other layouts and there is a narrow tab key\nto the right.\n\nThe variant without settings key is buggy: space bar width\nis only 50% of its usual size and tab key is as wide as the space.\nThis is problematic because a user expects a space bar to be there\nhits the tab instead. It happened to me a dosen times when editing\na google search query on a page with results using an input box before\nthe search results. When I try to type space it jumps down to the\nsearch box which goes after the search results. It is a very bad\nuser experience.\n\nI believe it\u0027s a bug in layout (caused by XML code for space to be\ncopy-pasted to create an entry for tab). The reason it\u0027s not\nreported/fixed is because most people do not disable \u0027settings\u0027\nkey in preferences and use the other version of the layout which is fine.\n\nUnfortunately the bug is propagated from the default to all the national\nlayouts so it need to be patched in all these places at once.\n\nFortunately the fix is obvious - just use the same layout as with\nthe settings key.\n\nTested by be using English and Russian layouts.

10277,staging: usbip: Process event flags without delay\n\ncommit 584c5b7cf06194464240280483ee0376cdddbbae upstream.\n\nThe way the event handler works can cause it to delay\nevents until eventual wakeup for another event.\n\nFor example on device detach (vhci):\n\n - Write to sysfs detach file\n    -\u003e usbip_event_add(VDEV_EVENT_DOWN)\n      -\u003e wakeup()\n\n#define VDEV_EVENT_DOWN (USBIP_EH_SHUTDOWN | USBIP_EH_RESET).\n\n - Event thread wakes up and passes the event to\n   event_handler() to process.\n\n - It processes and clears the USBIP_EH_SHUTDOWN\n   flag then returns.\n\n - The outer event loop (event_handler_loop()) calls\n   wait_event_interruptible().\n\nThe processing of the second flag which is part of\nVDEV_EVENT_DOWN (USBIP_EH_RESET) did not happen yet.\nIt is delayed until the next event.\n\nThis means the -\u003ereset callback may not happen for\na long time (if ever) leaving the usbip port in a\nweird state which prevents its reuse.\n\nThis patch changes the handler to process all flags\nbefore waiting for another wakeup.\n\nI have verified this change to fix a problem which\nprevented reattach of a usbip device. It also helps\nfor socket errors which missed the RESET as well.\n\nThe delayed event processing also affects the stub\nside of usbip and the error handling there.\n\nSigned-off-by: Max Vozeler \u003cmvz@vozeler.com\u003e\nReported-by: Marco Lancione \u003cmarco@optikam.com\u003e\nTested-by: Luc Jalbert \u003cljalbert@optikam.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

However the weight\ninserted by set_load_weight() remains at 0 giving the task insignificat\npriority.\n\nWith this fix the weight is reset to what the task had before being elevated\nto SCHED_RR/SCHED_FIFO.\n\nCc: Lennart Poettering \u003clennart@poettering.net\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Linus Walleij \u003clinus.walleij@stericsson.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Peter Zijlstra \u003ca.p.zijlstra@chello.nl\u003e\nLKML-Reference: \u003c1286807811-10568-1-git-send-email-linus.walleij@stericsson.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Ingo Molnar \u003cmingo@elte.hu\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

10298,"Palette with previews categories and view modes\n\nThis changeset contains the following improvements to the palette:\n\n1. Display modes. The palette now supports several different view\n   modes and you can switch these via the context menu. The modes\n   are:\n\n   a. Previews. This renders previews for all the views using the\n      current SDK platform theme screen density etc.\n   b. Small Previews. This is like (a) but scaled down to 75% size.\n   c. Tiny Previews. Like (a) but scaled down to 50% size.\n   d. Text + Icon. This shows an icon and the name of the view; this\n      is the same as what the palette has looked like before this\n      changeset.\n   e. Icons only.\n\n   All the modes except for the Text+Icon mode will lay out the\n   views in a row (with vertical centering) to fit as much as possible\n   in the available space for that category.\n\n   The view mode along with other view flags described below are\n   preserved across IDE sessions.\n\n2. An accordion view. The palette is now using an Accordion control\n   which means it by default will keep a single category open and it\n   will always ensure that ALL the category labels are visible in the\n   current view without scrolling. Via the context menu you can turn\n   off the auto-close of the previous category.  The accordion view\n   uses vertical scrollbars within each category content area if\n   necessary.\n\n   The accordion view renders the category headers using open/close\n   folder icons a bold font and a background gradient which varies\n   between the normal and hovered states.\n\n3. Categories. The category metadata is now used to organize the views\n   into a handful of different categories. The categories can be\n   enabled and disabled via the context menu. When you turn off\n   categories you get all the views in a single large list.\n\n4. Alphabetical sorting. By default the views are now sorted\n   \naturally\"" (e.g.  the metadata provided order where important\n   views are listed first). You can switch it to alphabetical order\n   via the context menu in which case the items are listed in\n   alphabetical order either within their individual categories or\n   if categories are turned off the global view list.\n\nThis changeset also adds a new SWT ImageControl. This is necessary to\ndisplay the preview images because the CLabel which is usually used\nto display images in SWT is hardcoded to hide the icon if there is\nnot enough horizontal space to display the full label (even when it\nhas no text label) so for wide preview images the images would simply\ndisappear when the palette was resized.\n\nChange-Id: I1e1fe051947809206ef9f3a2dfa2fbeae0341107\n"""

The\nnested key ref-counting has been masking bugs and complicating code\nanalysis. queue_lock() is only called with a previously ref-counted\nkey so remove the additional ref-counting from the queue_(un)lock()\nfunctions.\n\nAlso futex_wait_requeue_pi() drops one key reference too many in\nunqueue_me_pi().

10468,Translator: fix eglGetProcAddress() on Linux\n\nOur implementation of eglGetProcAddress() resolves the function addresses\nin run time. Typically this is not an issue but when a gl function is\nalso implemented by the calling app the address was resolved to the calling\napp\u0027s version of the function rather than ours. This is the case with the\nglDrawTex{isfx}OES functions in the 1.1 conformance test.\nThe solution is to add the -Bsymbolic switch when linking our libraries\nso all symbol resolution is done internaly.\nThe same fix should probably be done for Mac.\n\nChange-Id: I5507bdd8dd3a03f0aaa00e49830c4ff0a5cec84f\n
10469,Translator 1.1 conformance: fix ARRAY related gets\n\nThere is a set of glGets which query the client state of the\nbinded arrays. The data exists in the translator context and is not\npassed to GL so the glGets should be handled internaly.\nThis is done by implementing four glGet*v methods in GLEScontext which\nreturn a boolean value indicating whether we have set the return value\nor not and are called by the glGet*v functions in GLEScmImp.\nTwo of the glGets are handled by GLEScontext and the other 15 by\nGLEScmContext since they are specific to GLES 1.1. The same should be\ndone for 2.0 specific glGets in a later patch.\nAlso. bufferName is now saved in GLESPointer in to allow the\nGL_*_ARRAY_BUFFER_BINDING get.\n\nChange-Id: Ic0106f8696b4103525607cc4130e0a34f171d7e8\n

10471,1.1 Translator conformance: fix texture issues\n\nThis fixes three issues:\n\n1. glGet(GL_2d_TEXTURE_BINDING) should be handled by the translator rather\nthan by OpenGL.\n\n2. glIsTexture shoud return GL_TRUE only if the texture was bound at some\npoint - add a wasBound member to the TextureData and maintain it.\n\n3. glTexParameter(GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP) did not work. The first problem was\nthat it was not allowed by our validator - fixed. The next issue is that\nthis enum is not necessarily supported by the OpenGL implementation - it\nis in OpenGL 2.x but was replaced by an extension in 3.x. So in case the\nextension does not exist and GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP is required save this info\nin a new requiresAutoMipmap member of TextureData and call glGenerateMipmapExt\nwhenever glTex(Sub)Image2D is called.\nThere is a theoretical case where neither GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP nor glGenerateMipmap\nis supported by the OpenGL implementation - this is not likely to happen but\nif we find such an implementation it might require implementing a mipmap\ngeneration software algorithm (which is bad).\n\nChange-Id: I8fdc5b44cd7b0613adaa11c5dac438bcc1f7fc09\n

10479,Show correct date for downloads in the statusbar\n\nThe date was not set properly in notifications when the text for\nexpanded view was created.\n\nThis fix sets the displayed time to the download time for each\nindividual file. The DownloadProvider recreates the notifications\nseveral times but don\u0027t set the time before the expanded message\nis created. The expanded message will therefore display the time\nthe notification was created and not the time a file was downloaded.\nThe displayed time will in most case be the time when the last file\nwas downloaded.

We\ncan then unlock the hash table without risk of the socket going away. We then\nlock the socket which is safe because it is pinned. We can then call\ntcp_done() without recursive deadlock and without race. Upon return we unlock\nthe socket and then unpin it killing it.\n\nChange-Id: Idcdae072b48238b01bdbc8823b60310f1976e045\nSigned-off-by: Robert Love \u003crlove@google.com\u003e\nAcked-by: Dima Zavin \u003cdima@android.com\u003e\n

10581,The following changes improve the reporting done in HierarchyViewer via the ViewDebug interface.\n\nWind River has built a system testing platform for Android.  It is called STP - for System Testing Platform.\nWe use Android\u0027s adb to access ViewDebug in Android phones.  The ViewDebug interface is missing a few important\nvalues that we can use to run tests.  These changes add access to those values as described below;\n\nview/ViewDebug.java:  This change adds a screenX and screenY position for the overall view.  Without these\nvalues we cannot tell where a popup window is on the screen.  We use Monkey\u0027s network interface to click the\nAndroid screen in specific locations and we need to know where windows are positioned.\n\nwidget/AnalogClock.java:  We\u0027d like to know the time that the clock is showing to verify it.\n\nwidget/CheckedTextView.java:  We\u0027d like to know if the item is checked on not.\n\nwidget/CompoundButton.java:  We\u0027d like to know if the item is checked on not.\n\nwidget/ProgressBar.java:  we need to know isIndeterminate() getProgress() getSecondaryProgress() and\ngetMax() so we can understand what sliders and progress bars are showing.\n\nwidget/TextView.java: we need to know the current selection:  getSelectionStart() and getSelectionEnd()\n\nWe\u0027ve been testing versions of this code on Cupcake Donut and Eclair on emulators dev phones and other\ndevices.  We\u0027d like these changes in soon to be able to run our suites without asking our partners to change\ntheir Android sources and so we can test new phones without any patching just by plugging them in.\n\nThank you for your consideration.\n

10803,OMAP4: remoteproc: add rutime PM autosuspend support\n\nGoing to suspend and resuming for remote processor is a heavy\ntask and therefore much latency. For that reason we only going\nto suspend after some inactivity time. By itself remoteproc\nmodule can not know about activity on remoteproc (it is only\nin charge of turning it on/off) that is why remoteproc add\nnew APIs to tell when it is used and then restart suspend\ntimeout.\n\nRemote proc users needs to use that news apps. Besides if they\nhave issues when the remote processor goes to suspend without\ntheir knowledge about that they needs to register for suspend\nnotifications returning an error in the notification callback\nmeans they are using the remote processor and the autosuspend\nis cancelled.\n\nSigned-off-by: Fernando Guzman Lugo \u003cfernando.lugo@ti.com\u003e\n

10836,Early ANR detection\n\nLogs waiting times so we know when we are close to getting an ANR.\n\nNormally the ANR timeouts are 5 seconds meaning that if the delay\nfrom our keypress or screentouch until it is handled is longer\nthan 5 seconds we will get an ANR. We want to handle this BEFORE\nperformance is so bad that we actually get an ANR.\n\nAll delay times (\u003e\u003d 50 ms) from having received a keypress or\nscreentouch until it is handled by the current application are\nlogged to the event log.\n\nIt looks like this:\n...\nI/waiting_time_anr_head( 215): [AppWindowToken{2b3828f8 token\u003d\n HistoryRecord{2b1fb710 com.cooliris.media/.Gallery}}\n \u003cunavailable window\u003e7]\nI/waiting_time_anr_5_items( 215): [050005000123650035000\n 1236501050001236500850001236500350001426]\nI/waiting_time_anr_item( 215): [5500650001236]\nI/waiting_time_anr_item( 215): [6500950001426]\n...\n\nThis event:\nI/waiting_time_anr_head( 215): [AppWindowToken{2b3828f8 token\u003d\nHistoryRecord{2b1fb710 com.cooliris.media/.Gallery}}\n\u003cunavailable window\u003e7]\n\nTells us that the application is Gallery (the photo album)\nit has not currently got a window and it is reporting 7 delays.\nThis event shows the first 5 delays. The first \u00270\u0027 is the index\nof the first delay numbered 0-6. Then comes the delay the\ntimeout and the line number i InputDispatcher.cpp where this was\ndetected. This is repeated 5 times.\nI/waiting_time_anr_5_items( 215): [0500050001236500350001236\n501050001236500850001236500350001426]\n\nThen comes the last 2 delays:\nI/waiting_time_anr_item( 215): [5500650001236]\nI/waiting_time_anr_item( 215): [6500950001426]\n\nIt is shown which application and window that detected the delay.\nHowever it is not clear that this is the cause of the delay. It could\nbe some other application or background thread which is running.\n\nTo make data more compact delays will be collected in an array and\nevents sent to the event log when a keypress or screentouch delay is\nrecorded and one of these:\n\n1.  application or window is different than the last recorded one\n2.  5 minutes (300 seconds) have elapsed since last write to the event\n    log\n3.  array contains 200+ delays\n\nThe logging is done in class InputDispatcher::LogWaitingTimeANR.\n\nChange-Id: I99f00fbb5386bbc2f20518701c7fecd59005cbae\n

While playing streaming video we suspend/resume the device.We\n       would find the device always play the begining part of the audio\n       first.\nRootCause:\n    1. Although video playback has been paused because of seeking\naudioplayer wouldn\u0027t be paused and seek to the desired position until\nthe video event does so.\n    2. While suspend/resume audio player would be recovered faster than\nthe video. This would make the audioplayer to play the begining part of\nthe content till the video playback does the needed seeking\n\nSolution:\n    While playing video we would pause the audioplayer as long as the\nseeking occurs. After the related video event is triggered stagefright\nwould recover the audioplayer.\n\nChange-Id: I31e853bb37f57d987042ea2e86ee4a0b192e1ea4\n

10963,Fix incorrect orientation at boot.\n\nThe goldfish kernel\u0027s event driver is very picky about the\nstate of the virtual device it talks to. Essentially it can\nonly listen to h/w events if the corresponding IRQ is raised\n_after_ it has completed some initial setup.\n\nIf the IRQ is raised before the driver will refuse to listen\nto events and any interaction becomes impossible.\n\nWe changed the way our UI windows are built and managed\npreviously and this had the unfortunate effect of sending\none h/w event too soon which in the old code would raise\nthe IRQ prematurely. This resulted in an input freeze.\n\nTo work around this the UI code was modified to not send\nthe initial h/w event but this resulted in bad orientation\nof the home screen at the end of the boot sequence.\n\nThis change allows the virtual device to wait for the kernel\ndriver before raising the IRQ in the case any h/w event has\nbeen buffered. It also removes the hack in the UI code\nallowing the send of the initial h/w event at startup.\n\nBONUS MINOR CHANGES:\n    EsounD probe: fix error message.\n    console: fix compiler warnings\n    libpng: proper handling of MMX support.\n    android-configure.sh: fix --ignore-audio handling\n        The option didn\u0027t do anything if the audio development packages\n        are properly installed on the system.\n\nChange-Id: Ib134158873d5cb72290c9676d92d20233226c889\n

An example of an AP\naffected by this is the Nexus One but this has also been\nobserved with random APs.\n\nWe can probably optimize this later by using null funcs\ninstead of probe requests.\n\nFor more details refer to:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id\u003d5715\n\nThis patch has fixes for stable kernels [2.6.35+].\n\nCc: Paul Stewart \u003cpstew@google.com\u003e\nCc: Amod Bodas \u003camod.bodas@atheros.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Luis R.

11108,viafb: fix i2c_transfer error handling\n\ncommit 85c5702ac046b14713f776d59768252d8ed8018f upstream.\n\ni2c_transfer returns negative errno on error and number of messages\nprocessed on success. Just returning this value would give a poor\ninterface as it is not obvious that you must compare with 2 after reading\n1 or n bytes and with 1 after writing 1 byte to determine if it was\nsuccessful. To avoid this error prone interface convert the error code\nof a successful read/write to zero and all other non-negative values to\nan negative error code.\nThis fixes a regression introduced by\n\tvia: Rationalize vt1636 detection\nwhich resulted in no longer detecting a VT1636 chip and therefore has\nbroken the output in configurations which contain this chip.\n\nSigned-off-by: Florian Tobias Schandinat \u003cFlorianSchandinat@gmx.de\u003e\nAcked-by: Jonathan Corbet \u003ccorbet@lwn.net\u003e\nCc: Joseph Chan \u003cJosephChan@via.com.tw\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n

11114,[ARM/tegra] dma: add transfer count query. Checking interrupt pending status.\n Stopping Dma after last req transfer.\n\nadd an API to return the completed transfer count of a pending active\nor finished DMA request\n\noriginally fixed by Gary King \u003cgking@nvidia.com\u003e\n\nIt is observed that the dma interrupt has the lower priority then\nits client interupt priority. When client\u0027s isr calls dma get transfer\nthe dma status has not been upated as dma isr have not been served yet.\nSo before reading the status explicitly checking the interrupt status and\nhandling accordingly.\n\nThe another issue which is observed is that if dma has transferred the data\nof amount \u003d requested -4 and if it moves to invalid requestor before stopping\nthen status got reset and tarnsfered bytes becomes 0. This seems the apb dma\nhw behavior. Following is the suggestion to overcome this issue:\n- Disable global enable bit.\n- Read status.\n- Stop dma.\n- Enable global status bit.\n\nAdded this workaround and it worked fine.\n\noriginally fixed by Laxman Dewangan \u003cldewangan@nvidia.com\u003e\n\nIn continous mode dma should stop after last transfer completed and\nif there is no more req pending.\nIf there is pending req then it should check whether it has updated\nin hw for next transfer or not and if it has not started then stop dma\nand start new req immediatley.\n\noriginally fixed by Laxman Dewangan \u003cldewangan@nvidia.com\u003e\n\nChange-Id: I49c97c96eacdf4060de6b21cec0e71d940d33f00\n

11123,"Cluster of improvements for merge tag views\n\nThis changeset contains various improvements around usage of the\n\u003cmerge\u003e tag. Some of these fixes require layoutlib 5.\n\n* Use the new layoutlib support for rendering multiple children at the\n  root level - they now show up in the Outline (provided you are\n  running layoutlib 5) can be selected in the layout editor etc.\n\n* Add a drop handler such that you can drag into the \u003cmerge\u003e view and\n  get drop feedback (similar to the FrameLayout)\n\n* If the \u003cmerge\u003e is empty we don\u0027t get any ViewInfos so in that case\n  manufacture a dummy view sized to the screen. Similarly if we get\n  back ViewInfos that are children of a \u003cmerge\u003e tag in the UI model\n  create a \u003cmerge\u003e view initialized to the bounding rectangle of these\n  views and reparent the views to it.\n\n* Support highlighting multiple views simultaneously when you select\n  an include tag that renders into multiple views (because the root of\n  the included layout was a \u003cmerge\u003e tag).  Similarly make \Show\n  Included In\"" work properly for \u003cmerge\u003e views and make the overlay\n  mask used to hide all included content also reveal only the primary\n  selected views (when a view is included more than once.) (Also tweak\n  the visual appearance of the mask and use better icon for the view\n  root in the included-root scenario.)\n\n* Improve the algorithm which deals with render results with null\n  keys. Use adjacent children that -do- have keys as constraints when\n  attempting to match up views without keys and unreferenced model\n  nodes. This fixes issue\n      http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id\u003d14188\n\n* Improve the way we pick views under the mouse. This used to search\n  down the view hierarchy in sibling order. Instead search in reverse\n  sibling order since this will match what is drawn in the layout. For\n  views like FrameLayout and \u003cmerge\u003e views the children are painted\n  on top of ech other so clicking on whatever is on top should choose\n  that view not some earlier sibling below it.\n\n* Fix such that when you drag into the canvas we *always* target the\n  root node even if it is not under the mouse. This is particularly\n  important with \u003cmerge\u003e tags but this also helps if you for example\n  have a LinearLayout as the root element and the layout_height\n  property is wrap_content instead of match_parent. In that case the\n  LinearLayout will *only* cover its children so if you drag over the\n  visual screen it looks like you should be able to drop into the\n  layout but you cannot since it only covers its children. With this\n  fix all positions outside the root element\u0027s actual bounds are also\n  considered targetting the root.\n\n* Fix broken unit test add new unit tests.\n\nChange-Id: Id96a06a8763d02845af4531a47fe32afe703df2f\n"""

11464,ath9k: fix enabling ANI / tx monitor after bg scan\n\ncommit 48a6a468198aadb54bc5d3fdd065364d43ff5197 upstream.\n\nath9k\u0027s entire logic with SC_OP_SCANNING is incorrect due to the\nway mac80211 currently implements the scan complete callback and\nwe handle it in ath9k. This patch removes the flag completely in\npreference for the SC_OP_OFFCHANNEL which is really what we wanted.\n\nThe scanning flag was used to ensure we reset ANI to the old values\nwhen we go back to the home channel but if we are offchannel we\nuse some defaults. The flag was also used to re-enable the TX monitor.\n\nWithout this patch we simply never re-enabled ANI and the TX monitor\nafter going offchannel. This means that after one background\nscan we are prone to noise issues and if we had a TX hang we would\nnot recover. To get this to work properly we must enable ANI after\nwe have configured the beacon timers otherwise hardware acts really\noddly.\n\nThis patch has stable fixes which apply down to [2.6.36+] there\n*may* be a to fix this on older kernels but requires a bit of\nwork since this patch relies on the new mac80211 flag\nIEEE80211_CONF_OFFCHANNEL which was introduced as of 2.6.36.\n\nCc: Paul Stewart \u003cpstew@google.com\u003e\nCc: Amod Bodas \u003camod.bodas@atheros.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Luis R.

We could\npotentially run into a situation where tried to stop RX\nbut immediately started RX. This allows for races on the\nthe RX engine deciding what buffer we last left off on\nand could potentially cause ath9k to DMA into already\nfree\u0027d memory or in the worst case at a later time to\nalready given memory to other drivers.\n\nFix this by locking stopping RX.\n\nThis is part of a series that will help resolve the bug:\n\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d14624\n\nFor more details about this issue refer to:\n\nhttp://marc.info/?l\u003dlinux-wireless\u0026m\u003d128629803703756\u0026w\u003d2\n\nCc: Ben Greear \u003cgreearb@candelatech.com\u003e\nCc: Kyungwan Nam \u003ckyungwan.nam@atheros.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Luis R.

This causes surprise removal of hw. It can\nnever recover from this state and the hw will become usable only\nafter a power on/off cycle and sometimes only during a cold reboot.\n\nThis issue can be triggered by doing frequent roaming with the\nsimple/test-roam script available from the wifi-test project [1]\nwhen roaming between APs quickly. When roaming there is a is a high\npossibility that the device being put into idle (radio disable) state\nby mac80211 during AUTH-\u003eASSOC.

The ampdu_len field of the tx status is not always initialized for\nnon-HT frames (and it would probably be unreasonable to require all\ndrivers to do so). This could cause rate control statistics to be\ncorrupted. We now trust the ampdu_len and ampdu_ack_len fields only when\nthe frame is marked with the IEEE80211_TX_STAT_AMPDU flag.\n\n2. Successful transmission attempts where only recognized when the A-MPDU\nsubframe carrying the rate control status information was marked with the\nIEEE80211_TX_STAT_ACK flag. If this information happed to be carried on a\nframe that failed to be ACKed then the other subframes (which may have\nsucceeded) where not correctly registered. We now update rate control\nstatistics regardless of whether the subframe carrying the information was\nACKed or not.\n\nSigned-off-by: Björn Smedman \u003cbjorn.smedman@venatech.se\u003e\nAcked-by: Felix Fietkau \u003cnbd@openwrt.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: John W.

11515,r6040: Fix multicast filter some more\n\ncommit e2269308359d5863b6aa1fcb95a425a2ab255f1f upstream.\n\nThis code has been broken forever but in several different and\ncreative ways.\n\nSo far as I can work out the R6040 MAC filter has 4 exact-match\nentries the first of which the driver uses for its assigned unicast\naddress plus a 64-entry hash-based filter for multicast addresses\n(maybe unicast as well?).\n\nThe original version of this code would write the first 4 multicast\naddresses as exact-match entries from offset 1 (bug #1: there is no\nentry 4 so this could write to some PHY registers).  It would fill the\nremainder of the exact-match entries with the broadcast address (bug #2:\nthis would overwrite the last used entry).  If more than 4 multicast\naddresses were configured it would set up the hash table write some\nrandom crap to the MAC control register (bug #3) and finally walk off\nthe end of the list when filling the exact-match entries (bug #4).\n\nAll of this seems to be pointless since it sets the promiscuous bit\nwhen the interface is made promiscuous or if \u003e4 multicast addresses\nare enabled and never clears it (bug #5 masking bug #2).\n\nThe recent(ish) changes to the multicast list fixed bug #4 but\ncompletely removed the limit on iteration over the exact-match entries\n(bug #6).\n\nBug #4 was reported as\n\u003chttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d15355\u003e and more recently\nas \u003chttp://bugs.debian.org/600155\u003e.

11530,ath9k: fix power save race conditions\n\ncommit 8ab2cd09fecc8819bbaee2d0fd8f3a092d866ce3 upstream.\n\nath9k has a race on putting the chip into network sleep and\nhaving registers read from hardware. The race occurs because\nalthough ath9k_ps_restore() locks its own callers it makes use\nof some variables which get altered in the driver at different\ncode paths. The variables are the ps_enabled and ps_flags.\n\nThis is easily reprodicible in large network environments when\nroaming with the wpa_supplicant simple bgscan. You\u0027d get some\n0xdeadbeef read out on certain registers such as:\n\nath: timeout (100000 us) on reg 0x806c: 0xdeadbeef \u0026 0x01f00000 !\u003d 0x00000000\nath: RX failed to go idle in 10 ms RXSM\u003d0xdeadbeef\n\nath: timeout (100000 us) on reg 0x7000: 0xdeadbeef \u0026 0x00000003 !\u003d 0x00000000\nath: Chip reset failed\n\nThe fix is to protect the ath9k_config(hw IEEE80211_CONF_CHANGE_PS)\ncalls with a spin_lock_irqsave() which will disable contendors for\nthese variables from interrupt context timers re-entry from mac80211\non the same callback and most importantly from ath9k_ps_restore()\nwhich is the only call which will put the device into network sleep.\n\nThere are quite a few threads and bug reports on these a few of them are:\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+source/linux/+bug/407040\nhttp://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id\u003d5709\nhttp://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id\u003d5943\n\nStable fixes apply to [2.6.32+]\n\nCc: Paul Stewart \u003cpstew@google.com\u003e\nCc: Amod Bodas \u003camod.bodas@atheros.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Luis R.

11533,ath9k: A-MPDU rate control info fix\n\ncommit ebd022873aa61937603d2c4dfea19ce63ea1a3c8 upstream.\n\nThis patch fixes the following problems with the rate control feedback\ngenerated by ath9k for A-MPDU frames:\n\n1. Rate control feedback is carried on the first frame of an aggregate\nthat is either ACKed or has execeeded the software retry count and is\nconsidered failed. However ath9k would incorrectly assume the aggregate\nhad the length 1 if one of these conditions did not apply to the first\nframe of the aggregate but instead a later frame. This fix therefor\ncopies the bf_nframes field of the buffer in the same manner as the rates\nfield of the tx status.\n\n2. Sometimes the ampdu_len and ampdu_ack_len fields of the tx status was\nleft uninitialized eventhough the IEEE80211_TX_STAT_AMPDU flag was set.\nThis is now avoid by setting flag and fields in the same place.\n\n3. Even if a frame has been selected for aggregation by mac80211 and\nmarked with the IEEE80211_TX_CTL_AMPDU flag it can sometimes happen that\nath9k transmits the frame without aggregation. In these cases the\nampdu_ack_len field could be incorrectly computed because the nbad\nparameter to ath_tx_rc_status was incorrect.\n\nSigned-off-by: Björn Smedman \u003cbjorn.smedman@venatech.se\u003e\nAcked-by: Felix Fietkau \u003cnbd@openwrt.org\u003e\nSigned-off-by: John W.

As it turns out the scan flag will be set when we\nare already on the home channel.\n\nFor more details refer to:\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id\u003d5715\n\nThese issues will need to be considered for our solution on\nreshifting the scan complete callback location on mac80211 on\ncurrent development kernel work.\n\nThis patch has stable fixes which apply down to [2.6.36+]\n\nCc: Paul Stewart \u003cpstew@google.com\u003e\nCc: Amod Bodas \u003camod.bodas@atheros.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Luis R.

Because register_disk() also creates disk\u0027s kobject it\ncan happen that userspace manages to open and modify the device\u0027s data (or\ninode) before its BDI is properly initialized leading to a warning in\n__mark_inode_dirty().\n\nFix the problem by registering BDI early enough.\n\nThis patch addresses https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d16312\n\nReported-by: Larry Finger \u003cLarry.Finger@lwfinger.net\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara \u003cjack@suse.cz\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Jens Axboe \u003cjaxboe@fusionio.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman \u003cgregkh@suse.de\u003e\n
