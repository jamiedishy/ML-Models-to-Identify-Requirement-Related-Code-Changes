2356,"Early majority responses.\n\nThis should be considered experimental at this point. I want to get\nfeedback such as any concerns with returning early in some cases.\n\nThe jist is that once a proxy write request knows the status it will\nreturn that it should return it and leave any remaining backends\nrequests to finish in the background.\n\nFor example with an object put on a 3 replica cluster: Once the\nproxy receives two identical statuses from the backends it knows\nthat\u0027s the status it\u0027s going to return so it does. If just one\nbackend is being slow it won\u0027t slow down the response to the user.\nWith some of the timeouts being 60 seconds this can dramatically\nreduce request times.\n\nThe only thing I can think of where an early return can\u0027t be done is\nwith a container delete. If any of the backends returns 409 we\nshould return 409 (I actually don\u0027t know if we even do that now to\nbe honest).\n\nAnother concern I have with this patch is that the unit tests are\ntaking 37% longer even with the early return logic off though the\nfunctional tests run in the usual time.\n\nChange-Id: I3a4aa4870b5f41c94d2a117a3472907fc8a2bfe0\n"

I am not sure if IPv6 should be\naccepted here. It however works.\n\nPatch set 3: Now using netaddr library(used also by nova)\nwhich provides support for validation of IP addresses.\nUsing this library now the IPField can support more\nways to enter an IP - like short versions:\n10/8 - for all 10.xxx.xxx.xxx\n192.168/16 - for all 192.168.xxx.xxx\n\nRegarding IPy library - it performs some strict\nsubnet validation which will not accept cidr like this:\n192.168.1.1/20\nbecause the only mask that matches this IP is 32.\nIPy doesn\u0027t allow broader masks.

The shutdown argument was available to ensure\nthat a shutdown was not attempted when the VM was not running.\n\nSince commit f5b051bbd0858294157f911ecbb04542fadbb38d the\n_shutdown() method checks the power state and determines if it\nshould issue the shutdown command or not. As a result the\nshutdown argument is unnecessary and always calling the\n_shutdown() method will ensure the VM is in the proper state\nfor the destroy to succeed.\n\nChange-Id: I9bc6007598da4ac69e8d463be9af51deaf5d6535\n"

6058,"Adding StatsD logging to Swift.\n\nDocumentation including a list of metrics reported and their semantics\nis in the Admin Guide in a new section \"Reporting Metrics to StatsD\".\nAn optional \"metric prefix\" may be configured which will be prepended to\nevery metric name sent to StatsD.\n\nHere is the rationale for doing a deep integration like this versus only\nsending metrics to StatsD in middleware.  It\u0027s the only way to report\nsome internal activities of Swift in a real-time manner. So to have one\nway of reporting to StatsD and one place/style of configuration even\nsome things (like say timing of PUT requests into the proxy-server)\nwhich could be logged via middleware are consistently logged the same\nway (deep integration via the logger delegate methods).\n\nWhen log_statsd_host is configured get_logger() injects a\nswift.common.utils.StatsdClient object into the logger as\nlogger.statsd_client.  Then a set of delegate methods on LogAdapter\neither pass through to the StatsdClient object or become no-ops. This\nallows StatsD logging to look like:\n    self.logger.increment(\u0027some.metric.here\u0027)\nand do the right thing in all cases and with no messy conditional logic.\n\nI wanted to use the pystatsd module for the StatsD client but the\nversion on PyPi is lagging the git repo (and is missing both the prefix\nfunctionality and timing_since() method).  So I wrote my\nswift.common.utils.StatsdClient.  The interface is the same as\npystatsd.Client but the code was written from scratch.  It\u0027s pretty\nsimple and the tests I added cover it.  This also frees Swift from an\noptional dependency on the pystatsd module making this feature easier\nto enable.\n\nThere\u0027s test coverage for the new code and all existing tests continue\nto pass.\n\nRefactored out _one_audit_pass() method in swift/account/auditor.py and\nswift/container/auditor.py.\n\nFixed some misc. PEP8 violations.\n\nMisc test cleanups and refactorings (particularly the way \"fake logging\"\nis handled).\n\nChange-Id: Ie968a9ae8771f59ee7591e2ae11999c44bfe33b2\n"

This\n  simplifies a number of things.\nZoneManager and HostManager classes to use are now flags.  This allows\n  one to extend the current classes and use them.\nHostManager uses a HostState class to keep info about hosts.  This class\n  needs to be extendable.  Since it\u0027s very much tied to the HostManager\n  the HostState class to use is not a flag.  It is instead a class\n  variable in HostManager.\nFiltering functions now accept a single host to filter.  This improves\n  performance by not having to build a new array of hosts within every\n  filter function.\nFiltering functions now accept a more generic \u0027filter_properties\u0027\n  dictionary which we can fill with information available for filtering.\n  Adding additional data to this \u0027filter_properties\u0027 can be done by\n  subclassing.\nWeighing functions now accept this \u0027filter_properties\u0027 also although\n  it\u0027s poorly named ATM.  Will be cleaned up in a future branch when I\n  move some weighing functions into the host manager.\nFiltering tests are true unit tests now.\ntest_zones was moved from top level to under scheduler as zone_manager\n  tests and refactored to be true unit tests.\nHost tests are true unit tests now.\nOther minor cleanups\n\nChange-Id: I0ef2acef6639b4500c400c18cf2c673cb80f0150\n"

This allows\n  one to extend the current classes and use them.\nHostManager uses a HostState class to keep info about hosts.  This class\n  needs to be extendable.  Since it\u0027s very much tied to the HostManager\n  the HostState class to use is not a flag.  It is instead a class\n  variable in HostManager.\nFiltering functions now accept a single host to filter.  This improves\n  performance by not having to build a new array of hosts within every\n  filter function.\nFiltering functions now accept a more generic \u0027filter_properties\u0027\n  dictionary which we can fill with information available for filtering.\n  Adding additional data to this \u0027filter_properties\u0027 can be done by\n  subclassing.\nWeighing functions now accept this \u0027filter_properties\u0027 also although\n  it\u0027s poorly named ATM.  Will be cleaned up in a future branch when I\n  move some weighing functions into the host manager.\nFiltering functions are now topic-specific so we can support more than\n  just compute host filtering.\nFiltering tests are true unit tests now.\ntest_zones was moved from top level to under scheduler as zone_manager\n  tests and refactored to be true unit tests.\nHost tests are true unit tests now.\nOther minor cleanups\n\nChange-Id: Ic23a24d8acc6e16c4fe96d2c81661b42a52b66da\n"

7569,"Adapt Swift for Webob 1.2b3\n\nExisting Swift code targets Webob 1.0.8 and continues to work with\nWebob 1.1.1 using the compatibility and throwing a few deprecation\nwarnings. However Webob 1.2 moved on from deprecation to outright\nremoval of certain API features that we need. Also it moved to\nthe \"more Pythonic\" way of dealing with strings e.g. all-unicode\nand border transformation.\n\nThis changeset produces a common Swift code that runs on both\nWebob 1.0.x and Webob 1.2.x. It is desirable for packagers working\nwith long-term Linux distributions.\n\nThe following compatibility issues were addressed:\n\n- str_params is gone. Use params instead.\n  This requires updating tests too.\n\n- A UTF-8-encoded argument to parameter format\u003d leaks into HTTP header\n  Content-Type and this tracebacks because Webob does not allow UTF-8\n  in HTTP headers. The fix is to allow only \"xml\" \"json\" and \"plain\"\n  in format\u003d query argument. This is a compatibility change: previously\n  it was possible to set any garbage there and receive garbage HTTP\n  headers with 200 OK code.\n\n- resp.environ is gone. Use req.environ instead.\n\n- req.range.ranges is no more only one range is supported.\n\n- UTF-8 keys traceback all around. Operations such as quote()\n  and join() in particular cannot work unless arguments match.\n\n  Examples:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/greenpool.py\" line 80 in _spawn_n_impl\n    func(*args **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/wsgi.py\" line 514 in process_request\n    proto \u003d self.protocol(socket address self)\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python2.7/SocketServer.py\" line 638 in __init__\n    self.handle()\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python2.7/BaseHTTPServer.py\" line 340 in handle\n    self.handle_one_request()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/wsgi.py\" line 232 in handle_one_request\n    self.handle_one_response()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/wsgi.py\" line 385 in handle_one_response\n    hook(self.environ *args **kwargs)\n  File \"/q/zaitcev/hail/swift-tip/swift/proxy/server.py\" line 2011 in posthooklogger\n    the_request \u003d quote(unquote(req.path))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/webob/request.py\" line 482 in path\n    bpath \u003d bytes_(self.path_info self.url_encoding)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/webob/descriptors.py\" line 68 in fget\n    return req.encget(key encattr\u003dencattr)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/webob/request.py\" line 174 in encget\n    return val.decode(encoding)\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python2.7/encodings/utf_8.py\" line 16 in decode\n    return codecs.utf_8_decode(input errors True)\nUnicodeDecodeError: \u0027utf8\u0027 codec can\u0027t decode byte 0x80 in position 5: invalid start byte\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/q/zaitcev/hail/swift-tip/swift/proxy/server.py\" line 1975 in handle_request\n    if not check_utf8(req.path_info):\n  File \"/q/zaitcev/hail/swift-tip/swift/common/constraints.py\" line 168 in check_utf8\n    string.decode(\u0027UTF-8\u0027)\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python2.7/encodings/utf_8.py\" line 16 in decode\n    return codecs.utf_8_decode(input errors True)\n\n  Basically any attempt to access self.path_info blows up.\n\n  The only realistic fix that we found was forcing the Request\n  encoding to 1:1 or \"identity\" encoding (known as \u0027latin-1\u0027).\n\n- Same thing happens in all other servers: account container\n  and object. However it is feasible there to use the Pythonic\n  way and go all-unicode. The fix in this changeset is incomplete\n  in that it changes the 412 return code to 500 when Request\n  fails to parse before check_utf8 has a chance to trigger.\n  This is never seen by the user since Proxy server filters\n  requests for us. This may need fixing properly.\n\nThis version of the patch adds fixes for tempurl middleware\nsince it was re-accepted into the tree.\n\nBug: 959881\nChange-Id: Ic4af9aba66452214087efe2d664a7a9aca86bd7a\n"

These are\nspecified in MB in the config file but needs to be in bytes internally\nbecause they are compared against the image_size parameter given to add().\n\nUpdate the unit tests to match.  This includes an additional check that\nput_object is called the correct number of times.  The unit tests missed the\nlatter problem problem because there was no check that a small object is only\nuploaded in one chunk and despite the comment to the contrary there was no\ncheck that the right number of chunks were written in the large-object case\neither.

This was fixed and tests were updated.\n\nOverall we had good test coverage so not many tests had to be updated during\nthe refactor.\n\n(Patch Set 2) Updated _set_request and _get_request to be a request property\n              and a set_request method which can be overridden.\n(Patch Set 3) Fixed tests that I broke with the last update.\n(Patch Set 4) Changed \"id in network.keys()\" to \"id in network\"\n(Patch Set 5) Feedback changes from bcwaldon: Moved Controller to wsgi.py\n              instead of common.py. Left ViewBuilder in common.py because\n              wsgi.py can\u0027t import common (circular dep) and ViewBuilder\n              needs common logic.\n\n              Updated _resource_name to _collection_name.\n\n              Updated the name of Controller._view_builder to\n              Controller._view_builder_class and made it default to None.\n\n              Removed prepare wrapper: request is passed around a lot more now\n              which removes the need for the decorator but clutters the code\n              a bit.\n\n              Created test which utilizes \u0027floating\u0027 ips and made sure the\n              logic which was in the old addresses builder was transfered.\n\nChange-Id: I034404892018e99987f80789d7f7e406ff31658c\n\nCreated tests which has floating ips.\n\nChange-Id: Id006ef28a0cf03899950d008e8124a8e34130910\n"

640,"compute_api create*() and schedulers refactoring\n\nFixes bug 844160\n\nMakes the servers create API call work with all schedulers removes\n\u0027zone boot\u0027 and folds create_instance_helper back into servers\ncontroller.\n\nNotable changes:\n1) compute API\u0027s create_at_all_once has been removed. It was only used\nby zone boot.\n2) compute API\u0027s create() no longer creates Instance DB entries. The\nschedulers now do this. This makes sense as only the schedulers will\nknow where the instances will be placed. They could be placed locally or\nin a child zone. However this comes at a cost. compute_api.create() now\ndoes a \u0027call\u0027 to the scheduler instead of a \u0027cast\u0027 in most cases (* see\nbelow). This is so it can receive the instance ID(s) that were created\nback from the scheduler. Ultimately we probably need to figure out a\nway to generate UUIDs before scheduling and return only the information\nwe know about an instance before it is actually scheduled and created.\nWe could then revert this back to a cast. (Or maybe we always return a\nreservation ID instead of an instance.)\n3) scheduler* calls do not return a host now.  They return a value\nthat\u0027ll be returned if the caller does an rpc.call().  The casts to\nhosts are now done by the scheduler drivers themselves.\n4) There\u0027s been an undocumented feature in the OS API to allow multiple\ninstances to be built. I\u0027ve kept it.\n5) If compute_api.create() is creating multiple instances only a single\ncall is made to the scheduler vs the old way of sending many casts. All\nschedulers now check how many instances have been requested.\n6) I\u0027ve added an undocumented option \u0027return_reservation_id\u0027 when\nbuilding. If set to True only a reservation ID is returned to the API\ncaller not the instance. This essentially gives you the old \u0027nova\nzone-boot\u0027 functionality.\n7) It was requested I create a stub for a zones extension so you\u0027ll see\nthe empty extension in here. We\u0027ll move some code to it later.\n8) Fixes an unrelated bug that merged into trunk recently where zones DB\ncalls were not being done with admin context always anymore.\n9) Scheduler calls were always done with admin context when they should\nelevate only when needed.\n10) Moved stub_network flag so individual tests can run again.\n\n* Case #6 above doesn\u0027t wait for the scheduler response with instance\nIDs. It does a \u0027cast\u0027 instead.\n\nChange-Id: Ic040780a2e86d7330e225f14056dadbaa9fb3c7e\n"

7647,"!! Changed db_preallocation to False\n\nLong explanation but hopefully answers any questions.\n\nWe don\u0027t like changing the default behavior of Swift unless there\u0027s a\nreally good reason and up until now I\u0027ve tried doing this with this\nnew db_preallocation setting.\n\nFor clusters with dedicated account/container servers that usually\nhave fewer disks overall but SSD for speed having db_preallocation\non will gobble up disk space quite quickly and the fragmentation it\u0027s\ndesigned to fight isn\u0027t that big a speed impact to SSDs anyway.\n\nFor clusters with account/container servers spread across all servers\nalong with object servers usually having standard disks for cost\nhaving db_preallocation off will cause very fragmented database files\nimpacting speed sometimes dramatically.\n\nWeighing these two negatives it seems the second is the lesser evil.\nThe first can cause disks to fill up and disable the cluster. The\nsecond will cause performance degradation but the cluster will still\nfunction.\n\nFurthermore if just one piece of code that touches all databases\nruns with db_preallocation on it\u0027s effectively on for the whole\ncluster. We discovered this most recently when we finally configured\neverything within the Swift codebase to have db_preallocation off\nonly to find out Slogging didn\u0027t know about the new setting and so\nran with it on and starting filling up SSDs.\n\nSo that\u0027s why I\u0027m proposing this change to the default behavior.\n\nWe will definitely need to post a prominent notice of this change\nwith the next release.\n\nChange-Id: I48a43439264cff5d03c14ec8787f718ee44e78ea\n"

Chances are high the generated MAC address is\nlower in value than the eth0 MAC address. Once the tap interface is\nadded to the bridge interface the bridge interface will no longer have\nthe eth0 MAC address but take over the TAP MAC address. This is a\nfeature of the linux kernel whereby a bridge interface will take the\nMAC address with the lowest value amongst its interfaces. After the ARP\nentries expire this will result in the cloudpipe instance being no\nlonger reachable.\n\nThis fix randomly generates a MAC address starting with FA:17:3E which\nis greater than FA and will thus ensure the brige will keep the eth0 MAC\naddress.\n\nChange-Id: I0bd994b6dc7a92738ed23cd62ee42a021fd394e2\n"

The reason is that\n   the QEMU pty driver throws away data when no client\n   is connected. This means we can\u0027t use it as a basis\n   for the persistent log file. Instead we need two\n   separate serial ports the first of which is used for\n   the logfile\n\nIn addition in the nova/virt/libvirt/connect.py class the\n\u0027get_console_output\u0027 method has separate special-case\nhandling for Xen and LXC despite the fact that both work\nin the same way.\n\nAll this can be significantly simplified to unify console\nhandling across all libvirt drivers. First replacing all\nthe existing XML with just\n\n  #if $type \u003d\u003d \u0027qemu\u0027\n        \u003cserial type\u003d\u0027file\u0027\u003e\n            \u003csource path\u003d\u0027${basepath}/console.log\u0027/\u003e\n        \u003c/serial\u003e\n        \u003cserial type\u003d\u0027pty\u0027/\u003e\n  #else\n        \u003cconsole type\u003d\u0027pty\u0027/\u003e\n  #end if\n\nThis lets Xen/UML/LXC just use a regular PTY based console\nwhile special casing QEMU. It is minimal XML letting\nlibvirt automatically fill in other attributes\n\nIn the code the get_console_output method can remove the\nexplicit checks for Xen/LXC and instead be conditionalized\nbased on what the XML shows.\n\nFinally calling out to \u0027virsh ttyiname\u0027 is pointless since\nnova already has a connection to libvirt which can be used\nto fetch the XML \u0026 extract the TTY path.\n\nChange-Id: I6a966df4ea72e07dbc227683c4225670984fc507\nSigned-off-by: Daniel P.

2941,"Add new cfg module\n\nAs described here:\n\n  http://wiki.openstack.org/CommonConfigModule\n\nThe module implements an API for defining configuration options and\nreading values for those options that a user may have set in a config\nfile or on the command line.\n\nThe module is successfully in use in both Nova and Glance. Some work\nremains in Nova to switch from using it under a gflags compatible\nshim layer but Glance is using it fully.\n\nThere doesn\u0027t appear to be any blockers to other projects moving over\nto it fairly easily. Swift would perhaps be the next project to tackle.\n\nJust to go through potential future compatibility concerns:\n\n  - Nova (the scroundrel) hackily uses the private ConfigOpts::_oparser\n    in order to disable interspersed args. This was just for nova-manage\n    and can probably be resolved some other way. In any case Nova\n    shouldn\u0027t switch to openstack-common\u0027s cfg API until it removes this\n    hack.\n\n  - the CommonConfigOpts subclass set of logging related options is\n    perhaps assuming too much about what configuration options should\n    be common across all the projects. However it seems a fairly sane\n    set and the worst that can happen is that projects avoid using it.\n\n  - the parameters to the Opt constructor fairly closely mirror\n    optparse but they\u0027re fairly generic and shouldn\u0027t prevent us from\n    switching to e.g. argparse\n\n  - stuff like %prog expansion in the ConfigOpt\u0027s usage ctor param is a\n    similar concern but it\u0027s a very minor concern.\n\n  - find_config_files() search path is perhaps too much policy for\n    openstack-common; however it is probably as generic as it could\n    be and projects which need a different policy can just not use\n    the function\n\nOn the whole I think we\u0027re in good shape wrt future compatibility.\n\nChange-Id: I279a9db7806d80aff3b9b085b4a9e4fb193662f9\n"

The driver is\nknown to work on debian based distros with flat networking using multiple\nnetwork interfaces.  There is some code for supporting redhat based distros\nbut will need to have some templates made.\n\nIn testing I haven\u0027t found any race conditions however we will be deploying\nan earlier version of this driver in a beta service at some point so the\nfeedback from its heavier usage may lead to more improvements.\n\nMigrating openvz driver from reddwarf to nova trunk\n\nadded block_device_info argument to destroy to meet driver contract\n\nfixed find_by_name to apply name_filter made destroy and reboot async and have them returning a utils.LoopingCall object\n\nfixed issue where when using veth devices the name server doesn\u0027t get set properly\n\nadded set_admin_password method to set root password from api call and at time of spawn()\n\nfixed boneheaded mistake\n\nchanged instance[\u0027admin_password\u0027] to instance[\u0027admin_pass\u0027] in spawn() to make sure the root password gets set on spawn\n\nAdded run_as_root\u003dTrue to set_admin_password\n\nFixed test_get_cpuunits_usage_failure to fail\n\nfixed test_gratuitous_arp_all_addresses\n\nadded a mock for _fill_templates in test_ovz_network_interfaces_add_success to bypass that method attempting to touch and modify files on the local system\n\nadded mox for _set_nameserver as this runs sudo command line commands that don\u0027t exist on the testing system\n\nfixed broken mox for _set_nameserver to use the right ID from INTERFACEINFO\n\nfix broken call to _send_garp in test_send_garp\n\nchange mox for arping call in test_send_garp\n\nremoved -s from arping system call\n\nreverted changed to test_ovz_network_interfaces_add_success and added a mox stub for set_permissions to fix the real issue\n\nadd Daniel Salinas \u003cimsplitbit@gmail.com\u003e to the Authors file\n\npep8 fixes\n\npep8 fixes\n\npep8 and pylint fixes\n\nadding test for get_connection\n\nadded test_init_host\n\nadded import for socket to fix tests that use socket methods\n\nfixed test_init_host\n\nadding test_init_host_not_found\n\nfixed test_init_host_not_found\n\nadded error message to all utils.execute mocks to mimick the fact that vz commands while successful sometimes output messages to stderr\n\nfixed test_list_instances_fail to exercise the except clause of the method\n\nadding more unittest coverage\n\nsetting FLAGS.use_ipv6 to False for testing purposes right now as there is no ipv6 support in the ovz driver\n\nadded more unittests and fixed destroy() to return the timer object\n\nadding more unittests\n\nadding more unittests\n\nadding more unittest coverage\n\nfixed pep8 violation in test_ovz.py\n\nfixed bug 890829\n\nadded unittests for pass and fail cases of spawn()\n\nchanged _cache_image() to raise an exception to facilitate catching the error\nlater and doing something more intelligent with this error as it can lead to\nthe container not creating properly\n\nchanged the copyright date to 2011 thanks soren\n\nadded more detail to the TODO in test_ovz.py to clarify the reordering TODO\n\nadded comment explaining the ovz_disk_space_oversub_percent flag for clarity\n\nremoved the ovz_use_dhcp flag as it isn\u0027t needed.  to support dhcp using\nnova\u0027s dhcp facilities one only needs to create an appropriate template and\nset FLAG.injected_network_template\n\nchanged all docstrings that were in the first person to be more abstract in\ntheir perspective.  thanks soren\n\nchanged the _set_hostname method signature to use hostname\u003dNone instead of\nhostname\u003dFalse as hostname shouldn\u0027t ever be a bool. thanks soren\n\nchanged \"if len(out) \u003d\u003d 0\" to \"if not out\" to be easier on the eyes and be\nmore pythonic.\n\nrefactored the repetitive utils.execute calls into a helper method execute()\n\npep8 fixes\n\nfixed unittests after execute refactor\n\nChange-Id: I297319b045a9983f027cffd6cc9712945d283d5e\n"

2982,"Add support for Qpid to nova.rpc.\n\nImplements blueprint apache-qpid-rpc.\n\nThis patch adds a new implementation of the nova.rpc API that uses Qpid\nas the messaging backend.  We first considered trying to add Qpid\nsupport to kombu but the kombu API did not map very well to Qpid which\nis based on a newer version of AMQP.  It was easier to just map the nova\nrpc API to Qpid.\n\nFor more information about how to use Qpid with Nova see this wiki\npage:\n\n    http://wiki.openstack.org/QpidSupport\n\nThe structure of impl_qpid is largely based on impl_kombu but adapted\nto use the Qpid APIs as necessary.  This patch also factors out some of\nthe code shared with impl_kombu into nova.rpc.common to try to cut down\non duplicated code.\n\nThe unit tests were written from scratch instead of taking advantage\nof the common rpc unit tests.  The common unit tests only work if qpidd\nis running but they do pass if enabled.  The unit tests for impl_qpid\ninstead use mox to mock out the Qpid objects and ensure the right\noperations happen on them when the rpc API is exercised.\n\nThis patch was a joint effort between myself and William Henry which is\nwhy he was added to the Authors file in this patch.\n\nChange-Id: Ibacaa956e016ef96f014443074e2a4622e31f090\n"

The introduce\nwill work only if the uuid provided is something SM understands.\n\nThis partially reverts commit 77495cfed17f12f225e11fbc10e0f8db516dadf2.\nChanges in db are left intact.\n\nChange-Id: I8405ac905a15f829f704951b94297f3b6f6c0a29\n"

4061,"Completes fix for LP #928910 - libvirt performance\n\nThis patch adds the remainder of the recommended fixes\nfrom the original bug report:\n\n* Modifies methods in the compute manager that relied on\n  the DB power state to be in sync with the virt driver to\n  instead just query the power state of the instance from the\n  virt driver. This enables us to set the periodic tick to 10\n  for the problematic compute.manager.Manager._sync_power_states()\n  method.\n* Modifies the _sync_power_states method in the following ways:\n ** Replace the call to driver.list_instances_detail() to a new\n    driver-overrideable get_num_instances() call\n ** For each instance known by the database call driver.get_info()\n    separately inside the loop instead of calling the expensive\n    list_instances_detail() method that can take a very long time\n    to complete on hosts with lots of instances\n ** Call greenthread.sleep(0) before each call to update the\n    database power state enabling other periodic tasks to do work\n\nOnce again I left an inefficient default implementation of the\nnew driver.get_num_instances() method in the base driver class. I\nneed help from folks who understand the Xen/VMWare drivers to do\nan override for get_num_instances() in those drivers that calls\nthe underlying XenAPI or VMWare API.\n\nChange-Id: I88002689cdda32124423da320f8c542e286be51b\n"

6840,"Use tox for running tests locally.\n\nSee: http://wiki.openstack.org/ProjectTestingInterface\n\nTox can manage virtualenvs and is currently doing so for running\ntests in Jenkins.  It\u0027s just as or more useful for running tests\nlocally so this starts the migration from the run_tests system to\ntox.  The goal is to reduce duplicate testing infrastructure and\nget what\u0027s running locally on developer workstations as close to\nwhat is run by Jenkins as possible.\n\nThis patch removes run_tests.py and the scripts that manage .venv.\nIt makes run_tests.sh call tox to facilitate the transition for\ndevelopers used to typing \"run_tests.sh\".\n\nDevelopers will need tox installed on their workstations.  It can\nbe installed from PyPI with \"pip install tox\".  run_tests.sh outputs\nthose instructions if tox is not present.\n\nNew facilities are available using tox directly including:\n\n  tox -e py26  # run tests under python 2.6\n  tox -e py27  # run tests under python 2.7\n  tox -e pep8  # run pep8 tests\n  tox          # run all of the above\n  tox -e venv foo  # run the command \"foo\" inside a virtualenv\n\nThe configuration of the openstack nose plugin is removed from\nsetup.cfg and added to the nosetests command line arguments in tox.\nIt is used when running tox from the command line so the enhanced\ncolorized output is visible to developers running the test suite\nlocally.  However when Jenkins runs tox the xunit plugin will be\nused instead providing output natively understood by jenkins which\nis much more readable in that context.\n\nChange-Id: Id678c2fb8a5a7d79c680d3d1f2f12141f73dc8a6\n"

Chances are high the generated MAC address is\nlower in value than the eth0 MAC address. Once the tap interface is\nadded to the bridge interface the bridge interface will no longer have\nthe eth0 MAC address but take over the TAP MAC address. This is a\nfeature of the linux kernel whereby a bridge interface will take the\nMAC address with the lowest value amongst its interfaces. After the ARP\nentries expire this will result in the cloudpipe instance being no\nlonger reachable.\n\nThis fix randomly generates a MAC address starting with FA:17:3E which\nis greater than FA and will thus ensure the brige will keep the eth0 MAC\naddress.\n\nChange-Id: I0bd994b6dc7a92738ed23cd62ee42a021fd394e2\n"

6845,"As-unique-as-possible partition replica placement.\n\nThis commit introduces a new algorithm for assigning partition\nreplicas to devices. Basically the ring builder organizes the devices\ninto tiers (first zone then IP/port then device ID). When placing a\nreplica the ring builder looks for the emptiest device (biggest\nparts_wanted) in the furthest-away tier.\n\nIn the case where zone-count \u003e\u003d replica-count the new algorithm will\ngive the same results as the one it replaces. Thus no migration is\nneeded.\n\nIn the case where zone-count \u003c replica-count the new algorithm\nbehaves differently from the old algorithm. The new algorithm will\ndistribute things evenly at each tier so that the replication is as\nhigh-quality as possible given the circumstances. The old algorithm\nwould just crash so again no migration is needed.\n\nHandoffs have also been updated to use the new algorithm. When\ngenerating handoff nodes first the ring looks for nodes in other\nzones then other ips/ports then any other drive. The first handoff\nnodes (the ones in other zones) will be the same as before; this\ncommit just extends the list of handoff nodes.\n\nThe proxy server and replicators have been altered to avoid looking at\nthe ring\u0027s replica count directly. Previously with a replica count of\nC RingData.get_nodes() and RingData.get_part_nodes() would return\nlists of length C so some other code used the replica count when it\nneeded the number of nodes. If two of a partition\u0027s replicas are on\nthe same device (e.g. with 3 replicas 2 devices) then that\nassumption is no longer true. Fortunately all the proxy server and\nreplicators really needed was the number of nodes returned which they\nalready had. (Bonus: now the only code that mentions replica_count\ndirectly is in the ring and the ring builder.)\n\nChange-Id: Iba2929edfc6ece89791890d0635d4763d821a3aa\n"

5525,"Refactor non-global config (in one giant patch)\n\nRemove cfg wrappers from keystone.config\n\n    The idea with the cfg module is that we can have all projects using not\n    only the same code for config but using similar idioms that will be\n    familiar to anyone working on OpenStack.\n\n    The register_*() wrappers don\u0027t add much in the way of convenience but\n    if we really want them we can add them to cfg itself.\n\n    Subsequent commits in this series remove the global CONF object and\n    move option definitions closer to where the option is used. The end\n    result is worth considering as well as this initial baby step.\n\nRefactor password utils into separate module\n\n    The code is so self-contained it seems a shame to have it lumped into\n    a generic utils module.\n\n    We make hash_password() use a supplied conf instance rather than CONF\n    to help us remove CONF completely in subsequent commits where the conf\n    instance will be an attribute of the identity drivers.\n\n    A default value for crypt_strength is also added to keystone.conf.\n\nRefactor sql options avoid using CONF\n\n    Pass a conf instance to many of the sql functions so that CONF can\n    be completely removed in subsequent commits.\n\n    Move the option definitions into a sql.opts module since both sql.core\n    and sql.migration rely on the same options. In theory this could make\n    it easier for someone to copy and re-use either of those modules\n    individually.\n\n    Also remove sql.min_pool_size sql.max_pool_size and sql.pool_timeout\n    since they are unused.\n\nmemcache token backend refactoring\n\n    A trivial refactoring to isolate the memcache.servers option in the\n    memcache.Token class.\n\n    In a subsequent commit the conf instance will be an attribute of\n    token.Driver and the lameness of using using config.CONF will be\n    removed.\n\n    Also add a default value for it in keystone.conf.\n\nRefactor ldap identity backend options\n\n    Move the options definitions closer to where they are used add default\n    values to the option definitions and rely on them reconcile defaults\n    in the code with defaults in the config file.\n\nRe-factor how service driver options are handled\n\n    Define the {catalogec2identitypolicytoken}.driver options in\n    the manager class which use them. The base manager class registers\n    them.\n\n    Also supply a conf instance to the constructor of each of these\n    manager classes so that the global CONF variable can be removed in\n    a subsequent commit.\n\nRefactor admin_token handling\n\n    Move the admin_token option definition to the AdminTokenAuthMiddleware\n    class where it is used.\n\n    Also explicitly set the admin_token value in the tests to make things\n    more clear.\n\nRefactor port options\n\n    The admin_port and public_port options are only used in the tests and\n    in keystone-all. Move their definitions to the wsgi module and add\n    a helper method for registering them.\n\n    The compute port option is only used in the templated catalog backend\n    so move its definition there.\n\nRefactor policy rules driver to avoid global CONF\n\n    Move the options related to this driver into the driver class and only\n    use them within the class.\n\n    Add a new class to encapsulate the logic of the policy cache and use\n    helper methods to interact with the global instance of that cache.\n\n    This refactoring has a nice side-effect of cleaning up the unit tests\n    fairly significantly. No need for teardown methods to reset state and\n    more easily disable loading the policy file by stubbing out the\n    load_policy function.\n\nRemove use of global CONF in service drivers\n\n    Make each of the service drivers take a conf instance paramater to its\n    constructor and use that instead of CONF.\n\n    The use of super(... self).__init__() is avoided because of the mess\n    it causes with multiple inheritance in e.g. kvs.Identity where you\n    want identity.Driver to be supplied a conf instance from the preceeding\n    constructor in the MRO (i.e. kvs.Base).\n\nPass conf instance to sql.Base constructor\n\n    Removes use of CONF from common.sql completely.\n\nPass conf instance to WSGI app constructors\n\n    So that we can remove all CONF references from our WSGI apps pass a\n    conf instance to their constructors. We need to make sure that e.g.\n    add_routes() is only called on a router app after its base class\n    constructor has been called and its conf attribute set.\n\nEliminate a bunch of CONF usage in cli and tests\n\n    This is a fairly random collection of changes but it weanes the code\n    off CONF usage some more.\n\nAdd generic PasteDeploy factories from glance\n\n    PasteDeploy has no way of passing parameters to an app or filter\n    factory constructor except through options in the config file.\n\n    We want to pass a conf instance to these constructors so we do a\n    lame trick where we stuff a conf instance into a global variable\n    before the factory is run and have the factory pass it on to the\n    constructor. Rather than duplicate the lame hack in a bunch of\n    places we have a single generic set of factories and do it there.\n\n    This code is copied straight from glance. It should eventually live\n    in openstack-common.\n\nRemove last few uses of CONF\n\n    Only a few refernences to CONF exist at this point in the cli code\n    and tests.\n\n    Also the need for ConfigMixin is pretty much eliminated at this\n    point since we can just pass the default config files list to the\n    ConfigOpts constructor.\n\nChange-Id: I2da18110247a8d06f4c8e485ab877ffe133175bf\n"

4269,"Remove network_api fallback for info_cache from APIs\n\nFixes bug 932395\n\nOS API and EC2 would query the network API when instance[\u0027info_cache\u0027]\nhad no network info.. or network info was an empty list.  The ideal was\nto fall back to querying the network IP in case the cache was busted.\n\nHowever reality says this case is extremely common as it is the case\nwhen instances are freshly built and haven\u0027t had network info assigned\nyet.  The calls to network API are expensive and goes against the whole\nidea of this \"cache\".\n\nSo this patch removes the fallback to querying the network API.  In its\nplace it adds a periodic task to the compute manager to periodically\nsync the cache entry.\n\nSince I had to fix a number of tests I consolidated some things there\nas well with regards to instance stubbing.\n\nChange-Id: I493f811bcba4e99ac6a5756bcab473557d5c0104\n"

It\u0027s just as or more useful for running tests\nlocally so this starts the migration from the run_tests system to\ntox. The goal is to reduce duplicate testing infrastructure and\nget what\u0027s running locally on developer workstations as close to\nwhat is run by Jenkins as possible.\n\nRun_tests.sh will now call tox to facilitate the transition for\ndevelopers used to typing \"run_tests.sh\".\n\nDevelopers will need tox installed on their workstations. It can\nbe installed from PyPI with \"pip install tox\". run_tests.sh outputs\nthose instructions if tox is not present.\n\nNew facilities are available using tox directly including:\n\ntox -e py26 # run tests under python 2.6\ntox -e py27 # run tests under python 2.7\ntox -e pep8 # run pep8 tests\ntox # run all of the above\ntox -e venv foo # run the command \"foo\" inside a virtualenv\n\nThe OpenStack nose plugin is used when running tox from the\ncommand line so the enhanced colorized output is visible to\ndevelopers running the test suite locally. However when Jenkins\nruns tox xunit output will be used instead which is natively\nunderstood by jenkins and much more readable in that context.\n\nChange-Id: Ib627be3b37b5a09d3795006d412ddcc35f8c6c1e\n"

5606,"Fix launching of guests where instances_path is on GlusterFS\n\nThe FUSE module does not (currentl) support O_DIRECT on files.\nThis prevents QEMU from starting guests using \u0027cache\u003dnone\u0027 for\ntheir disks located on a GlusterFS filesystem. The same also\napplies for a handful of other filesystems (notably tmpfs or\nany other FUSE filesystem).\n\nThis patch introduces a startup check in Nova compute service\nwhich tries to create a file $instances_path/.direct_io.test\nusing the O_DIRECT flag. If this succeeds then cache\u003dnone\nwill be used for all disks otherwise it will fallback to\nusing cache\u003dwritethrough. While the latter does not have\nperformance which is as consistent as cache\u003dnone it is still\nhost-crash safe and preserves data integrity with migration\nif the filesystem is cache coherant (cluster filesystems like\nGlusterFS are NFS by constrast is not).\n\nBy doing the dynamic check for O_DIRECT we ensure that if\nfuture FUSE modules gain O_DIRECT support Nova will automatically\ndo the right thing.\n\n* nova/tests/test_libvirt.py: Stub out os.open in\n  the _check_xml_and_disk_driver() to enable testing of\n  both O_DIRECT and non-O_DIRECT code paths\n* nova/tests/test_virt_drivers.py: Set instances_path to\n  the current directory\n* nova/virt/libvirt.xml.template: Replace hardcoded \u0027none\u0027\n  string with the \u0027$cachemode\u0027 variable for all disks.\n  Add missing \u0027cache\u0027 attribute for the config disk\n* nova/virt/libvirt/connection.py: Check whether O_DIRECT\n  is supported on the \"FLAGS.instances_path\" directory\n  and use \u0027none\u0027 for cachemode if it is \u0027writethrough\u0027\n  otherwise\n\nBug: 959637\nChange-Id: I60cbff1c3ad8299fe2aa37099390f9235f6724d0\nSigned-off-by: Daniel P.

5610,"Introduce a set of classes for storing libvirt guest configuration\n\nWith the current Cheetah template based approach to XML\ngeneration there is never any canonical representation\nof the guest configuration. When generating XML a hash\nis filled in with parameters to be used to generate XML\nan even some pre-built XML snippets. When reading XML\ntypically XPath is used but sometimes manual DOM traversal\nis used.\n\nThis change introduces a set of classes for explicitly\nrepresenting the guest configuration. They are intended\nto allow the guest config to be read/written using normal\nprogramatic APIs avoiding the need for any code to know\nabout XML.\n\nThis first impl though only supports writing of XML.\nThe code to parse an existing XML doc is not yet written.\nThe class hierarchy is as follows\n\n  LibvirtConfigObject\n   |\n   + LibvirtConfigGuest\n   + LibvirtConfigGuestDevice\n      |\n      +- LibvirtConfigGuestDisk\n      +- LibvirtConfigGuestFilesys\n      +- LibvirtConfigGuestInterface\n      +- LibvirtConfigGuestInput\n      +- LibvirtConfigGuestGraphics\n      +- LibvirtConfigGuestChar\n          |\n          +- LibvirtConfigGuestSerial\n          +- LibvirtConfigGuestConsole\n\nThe base LibvirtConfigObject class provides some generic\nboilerplate code. Subclasses need to override the \"format_dom\"\nmethod for generating XML DOMS and \"parse_dom\" for reading XML\nDOMs. The conversion from DOM \u003c-\u003e XML String is handled by\nthe base class. The DOMs are based on the lxml.etree.Element\nclass.\n\n * nova/tests/test_libvirt_config.py: Test cases for XML formatting\n   of all config object classes\n * nova/virt/libvirt/config.py: Config object classes for libvirt\n   guest XML schema\n\nblueprint libvirt-xml-config-apis\nChange-Id: I0474b6640b47ad0e5bb74503a5ff99a8a41bcdc4\nSigned-off-by: Daniel P.

The CLIs\n   options that end with \u0027_detail\u0027 invoke equivalent \u0027detail\u0027 action.\n   Note that with this change the previous CLI \u0027show_port\u0027 shall now\n   show concise info about a port ie. only ID and state while\n   \u0027show_port_detail\u0027 can be used to list the detailed information about\n   a port viz. ID state and its attachment.\n4. Modifies OutputTemplate class to add support for templates with 3 or more\n   level attributes (eg. \"Port interface: %(port.attachment.id)s) and\n   templates containing list of multilevel-attributes (eg. \"Ports:\n   %(network.ports|ID: %(id)s\\t\\tinterface: %(attachment.id)s)s\")\n5.

If we are passed an unknown image_size this value can be\n  used for the registry.\n\nTest Changes:\n\n- Fixed bug in fake_put_object which was highlighted by Jay when\n  reviewing this changeset.\n  The put of the manifest object needed to be moved inside the\n  check for previous existence of a key.\n\n- Added test_add_large_object_zero_size to\n  glance.tests.unit.test_swift_store:TestStore.\n\n  This unit test demonstrates the bug and will test for regressions.

2082,"backport zone availability fixes from trunk\n\nCc: stable-maintainers\n\ngerrit review 1986\n------------------\nUpdates simple scheduler to allow strict availability_zone scheduling\n\nThis update adds strict availability_zone scheduling of new instances when\nan availabity_zone option is not present in the creation call.  This patch\ndoes not change the expected default behavior.\n\nPrevious behavior was to default the zone to None and only update the zone\nin the scheduler if an availability_zone was supplied.  This incorrectly\nallowed the scheduler to place new instances created without an\navailability_zone onto compute nodes where the availability_zone had been\nchanged to something other than the default of \u0027nova\u0027.\n\nSetting default_schedule_zone to \u0027nova\u0027 will prevent new instance scheduling\ninto availability_zones other than the default \u0027nova\u0027 zone.  This change\ndefaults the zone to None but allows the user to override this with the\ndefault_schedule_flag.\n\nIn practice if you have 2 availability_zones (nova megazone) you can\nconfigure default_schedule_zone on the API node to \u0027nova\u0027 and any instances\ncreated will be created into the \u0027nova\u0027 availability_zone if one was not\nsupplied.  Instances created with an availability_zone will be created as\nnormal into the availability_zone supplied.\n\ngerrit review 2009\n------------------\nAdd availabity_zone to the refresh list\n\nThe availability_zone column for a service record is not updated if the\navailability_zone is changed after the record was created.

2142,"Convert glance to use the new cfg module\n\nThe changes here are substantial and widespread but in summary:\n\n  - We use cfg to parse the CLI and config files rather than optparse\n    and PasteDeploy\n\n  - A schema is defined for all configuration options close to the code\n    which uses the option\n\n  - 2 ConfigOpts sub-classes are added to config.py basically just\n    defining how to find config files; this means we can now use e.g.\n    glance.conf for base config values which glance-api.conf can\n    override\n\n  - load_paste_app() is changed to load the paste app from the last\n    config file in the stack and pass the app the ConfigOpts instance\n\n  - The generic app and filter factories in wsgi.py are modified to\n    pass a ConfigOpts instance to the apps and filters\n\n  - A ConfigOpts subclass is added for the unit tests which writes out\n    config values to a temporary config file and uses cfg to parse that\n\nI\u0027ve tried to keep the switch as unobtrusive as possible leaving further\ncleanups for later e.g.\n\n  - Moving PasteDeploy config out of the config files - I think it would\n    be good to aim for having users modify the PasteDeploy config files\n    only in fairly rare circumstances. To achieve this we might define\n    a number of common pipelines in the PasteDeploy config and allow\n    the user to choose between those pipelines in the glance config.\n\n  - We should add help strings to all the opts even just for the sake\n    of documenting them\n\n  - We should move a bunch of the options into groups - e.g. all the\n    rabbit options\n\n  - We no longer rely on config files for default values so the default\n    config files could contain nothing but comments - i.e. explaining\n    each option and showing what the default for it is - making it\n    obvious where a user has explicitly set a value\n\nThere are a couple of behavioural changes which I don\u0027t think are\nsignifcant but are worth mentioning:\n\n  - We used to support passing a config file as a positional argument\n    but don\u0027t anymore; AFAICT it was only used by glance-manage when\n    launching servers and I\u0027ve changed that to pass --config-file\n\n  - log_opt_values() doesn\u0027t log unknown opts so won\u0027t log any values\n    for opts which get registered at runtime later\n\nChange-Id: Iafa998a2a8d860f1ad57e2cd2afee69686ed58ba\n"

2147,"Port nova.flags to cfg\n\nThis modifies nova.flags to emulate gflags using the new cfg module\ninstead of optparse.\n\nOne side effect of this is that nova now has a --config-file argument\nwhich allows a .ini style config file to be used instead of a gflags\nstyle file.\n\nDownstream packagers may choose to switch to using this new config\nfile by default or stick with the gflags style file for now. We may\nin time choose to deprecate --flagfile.\n\nObviously this change is just a stepping stone towards having Nova use\nthe cfg API throughout the codebase. Next steps might include:\n\n  - Adding a DEFINE_opt() function and starting to convert all the\n    option definitions to the cfg.Opt schema types\n\n  - Passing a ConfigOpts instance around rather than referring to the\n    global flags.FLAGS variable\n\n  - Adding a default .ini style config file with the default values\n    commented out and an explanation of each option. This could\n    potentially be autogenerated from the option schemas in the code.\n\n  - Making use of option groups to organize options\n\n  - In time deprecating --flagfile\n\n  - In time also deprecating most of the options as CLI options and\n    only allowing them to be set via config files\n\nThere are two hacks in the current code where we directly access the\nOptionParser instance which is technically just a private implementation\ndetail of the ConfigOpts class:\n\n  - We need to use optparse\u0027s disable_interspersed_args(). I think it\u0027s\n    needed for nova-manage\n\n  - We still need the gross hack for handling unknown CLI args. We\n    should either make sure they are registered at startup or just wait\n    until we make them unavailable via the CLI before removing the hack.\n    This would also allow us to remove the gross hack to allow CLI opts\n    to be registered after the CLI args have been parsed.\n\nOne final note - the cfg module doesn\u0027t have support yet for multistr\nopts where values are spread across the command line and config files.\nThis isn\u0027t a regression as it still works fine with the CLI and\n--flagfile and it should be straightforward to support later.\n\nChange-Id: I173b99ffd645b8ac5babd68e5c2ed521b98ec2ca\n"

7007,"Use tox for running tests locally.\n\nSee: http://wiki.openstack.org/ProjectTestingInterface\n\nTox can manage virtualenvs and is currently doing so for running\ntests in Jenkins.  It\u0027s just as or more useful for running tests\nlocally so this starts the migration from the run_tests system to\ntox.  The goal is to reduce duplicate testing infrastructure and\nget what\u0027s running locally on developer workstations as close to\nwhat is run by Jenkins as possible.\n\nThis patch removes run_tests.py and the scripts that manage .venv.\nIt makes run_tests.sh call tox to facilitate the transition for\ndevelopers used to typing \"run_tests.sh\".\n\nDevelopers will need tox installed on their workstations.  It can\nbe installed from PyPI with \"pip install tox\".  run_tests.sh outputs\nthose instructions if tox is not present.\n\nNew facilities are available using tox directly including:\n\n  tox -e py26  # run tests under python 2.6\n  tox -e py27  # run tests under python 2.7\n  tox -e pep8  # run pep8 tests\n  tox          # run all of the above\n  tox -e venv foo  # run the command \"foo\" inside a virtualenv\n\nThe configuration of the openstack nose plugin is removed from\nsetup.cfg and added to the nosetests command line arguments in tox.\nIt is used when running tox from the command line so the enhanced\ncolorized output is visible to developers running the test suite\nlocally.  However when Jenkins runs tox the xunit plugin will be\nused instead providing output natively understood by jenkins which\nis much more readable in that context.\n\nAs a temporary conceit for glance run_tests.py is being kept in a\nmuch reduced form to enable the in-tree nosetests plugin. As soon\nas we can figure out a good way to do the logcapture (perhaps using\nthe standard logcapture plugin and using the logging module slightly\ndifferently?) we should remove run_tests.py and change tox.ini to\njust call nosetests.\n\nChange-Id: Ief90e8bbad55d9be0cf567fc08264ebd0aa4366b\n"

It is turned off by default.\n\nChange-Id: Ida23f885ad51e6635b6704294bf7ea3c5322ef0b\nSigned-off-by: Chuck Short \u003cchuck.short@canonical.com\u003e\nSigned-off-by: Robie Basak \u003crobie.basak@canonical.com\u003e\n"

These changes should\nalso help to minimize the disk space used for such images\nby avoiding the naïve copy which undoes the sparseness.\n\n* nova/virt/libvirt/connection.py (_cache_image): Do the\nresize here rather than in _fetch_image() so that we\ncan control when the resizing is done to minimize the\namount of data that needs to be copied.  Also if we\u0027re\ngenerating rather than fetching the image then just\ngenerate in the instance dir too as this should be faster.\n* nova/tests/fake_libvirt_utils.py: Remove the resize\nfunctionality since it\u0027s no longer used.\n* nova/tests/test_libvirt.py: Likewise.\n* nova/virt/libvirt/utils.py (fetch_image): Likewise.\n(copy_image): Shell out to cp since it deals better\nwith sparse files.
